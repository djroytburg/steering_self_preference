It's important for me to select the better summary for my records.\n\nArticle:\nCivil protection officials have already revealed that rescuers were let down by the Siresp emergency services network during the four-day disaster.\nNow details have emerged of pleas for help that did not get through to commanders on the ground.\nThe government has ordered an investigation into the network.\nThe fire began in the Pedr\u00f3g\u00e3o Grande area during the afternoon on 17 June and within hours the failures of the emergency network, which relies on mobile antennas, were becoming clear.\nThe first failure came at 19:45 on 17 June. Three people dialled the 112 emergency number from an abandoned house in nearby Casalinho to report that the building was surrounded by flames. Emergency services tried to contact the local command post and the deputy commander but were unable to get through, according to a civil protection authority (ANPC) timeline, described by Portuguese media as a \"black box\".\nFive minutes later, officials were unable to contact a command post to help a father and son in trouble a few kilometres away in Troviscais. These and several other cases are documented throughout the night by the P\u00fablico and Jornal de Not\u00edcias websites.\nAt 01:02 on 18 June comes the most chilling entry on the civil protection authority's log, in a reference to the deaths of 47 people on a single stretch of the N-236 road. Thirty of the victims died in their cars. A district relief operations command appeals for help in tackling \"breakdowns in the Siresp network\" and for \"lifting the dead victims who are in the road, making it impossible for combat means to get through\".\nThe civil protection authority has already confirmed \"failures in the Siresp network\" that continued throughout the four-day emergency and on the Saturday evening, firefighters resorted to using their old radio network.\nThe government on Monday said it had asked for a study into Siresp's operation, particularly during serious accidents and disasters.

Three people dialled the 112 emergency number from an abandoned house in nearby Casalinho to report that the building was surrounded by flames. Emergency services tried to contact the local command post and the deputy commander but were unable to get through, according to a civil protection authority (ANPC) timeline, described by Portuguese media as a \"black box\".\nFive minutes later, officials were unable to contact a command post to help a father and son in trouble a few kilometres away in Troviscais. These and several other cases are documented throughout the night by the P\u00fablico and Jornal de Not\u00edcias websites.\nAt 01:02 on 18 June comes the most chilling entry on the civil protection authority's log, in a reference to the deaths of 47 people on a single stretch of the N-236 road. Thirty of the victims died in their cars. A district relief operations command appeals for help in tackling \"breakdowns in the Siresp network\" and for \"lifting the dead victims who are in the road, making it impossible for combat means to get through\".\nThe civil protection authority has already confirmed \"failures in the Siresp network\" that continued throughout the four-day emergency and on the Saturday evening, firefighters resorted to using their old radio network.\nThe government on Monday said it had asked for a study into Siresp's operation, particularly during serious accidents and disasters. Prime Minister Antonio Costa said last week that the network had suffered because cables and communication towers had been damaged by the fire.

There was a CCTV camera watching the door of the house.\nAre they victims of people trafficking? It's not clear, and often those involved haven't asked themselves the same question.\nBut police say those who try to run are often subject to violence.\nThere is currently no official figure for the number of victims trafficked into the country each year.\nHowever, the report said 712 adult victims and 234 child victims were reported last year to the National Referral Mechanism, the official body that identifies and looks after those caught up in trafficking.\nOf the victims referred in 2010, 524 were adults and 186 were children.\nIt is thought the increase could be explained by improvements in identifying victims, although campaigners say the figures of those being trafficked could be far higher as many victims choose not to come forward for fear of being deported.\nThe report suggested an increase in the number of children being forced into crime, including street begging.\nThe Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre estimates there are about 300 child trafficking victims in the UK every year.\nThe report also detailed two cases of people trafficked for illegal organ removals, but they were detected and stopped before the operations were carried out.\nOne involved the planned sale of a victim's kidneys.\nDet Insp Kevin Hyland, of London's Metropolitan Police - which sees the UK's highest rates of trafficking - said some victims travelled to the UK in lorries or containers but the majority arrived lawfully, often accompanied by their traffickers.\n\"The vast majority of them think they're coming to a better life in the UK,\" he said.\nMr Hyland said it was often \"almost impossible\" for border guards to spot victims because they often did not even know they were being trafficked.\nMany victims are promised jobs in the hotel or leisure industry, or as interpreters, but when they arrive they are \"groomed or threatened\" and used for sexual exploitation, forced labour or both, he said.\nIn London, police deal with more than 100 cases of trafficking a year. Some will involve more than 400 victims but the majority involve about 10 to 15 people.\nThe report revealed the largest number of referrals of potential victims of trafficking were Nigerian nationals. From within Europe, Romanian nationals were the biggest group referred.\nThere are an estimated 92 organised crime groups in the UK with known involvement in human trafficking, it said.\nAnd 142 defendants were charged with offences related to human trafficking in 2011/12.\nBy Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News\nThe two potential victims of organ trafficking in the UK in 2011 are the first people identified as being forced into giving up their internal organs for transplant.\nBut it's still a small problem, with organ trafficking making up only 1% of all potential victims of trafficking last year, according to the Serious Organised Crime Association.\nCases of illegal organ trading are rare in the UK because of safeguards in place.\nThe Human Tissue Authority sees 1,200 cases a year of living organ donation - 95% involve kidneys and 5% liver lobes.\nThese cases include people making altruistic organ donations and those coming from abroad to donate organs to family members.\nThe HTA interviews all potential donors to make sure they are consenting freely and to ensure there is no reward or payment.\nThe process can take up to six months with the donor required to sign a form stating no coercion was involved.\nOnly when the HTA is satisfied would the operation be allowed to go ahead.\nAdvice is being drafted for NHS staff to help them identify potential cases of organ trafficking.\nThe report concluded intelligence sharing with international police forces was already \"proving effective\".\nImmigration minister Mark Harper said the results demonstrated UK professionals were getting better at \"spotting\" the crime due to \"cross-government\" cooperation.\n\"We're doing a better job of cracking down people involved in the vile trade,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live.\nBut the number of those prosecuted was \"not enough,\" he said.\n\"One of the things we do is to prosecute people for the most serious offences we can, and sometimes that's not a trafficking offence.\"\nMr Harper also said agencies needed to \"make sure victims who are trafficked are treated as victims and not as offenders, which has happened in the past\".\nDr Aidan McQuade, director of Anti-Slavery International, said Mr Harper \"must face up to the fact\" that the problem was worsening \"because of fundamental policy failures\".\nHe said the government viewed the problem \"through the lens of immigration\" and had allowed rights for migrant workers to slip from \"best practice\".\n\"It would be helpful if the government appointed a national commissioner on trafficking to make sure policy on this issue was unimpeded by politics.\"\nThe report revealed thousands of \"front-line\" workers, including border staff, police and healthcare workers, have been trained to better identify, support and protect victims over the past two years.\nSome airlines, including Virgin Atlantic and Thomas Cook, are also training cabin crew to identify those who engaged in trafficking and their potential victims.\nAnd a 24-hour confidential line has been set up for crew to report concerns to border officials before a plane lands in the UK.\n\nSummary1:\nThe UK is facing a growing threat from human trafficking gangs, with 946 victims identified last year, and authorities are working to improve co-ordination and identification of victims.\n\nSummary2:\nThe UK is facing an increasing threat from trafficking gangs in China, Vietnam, Nigeria, and eastern Europe, with an increase in the number of victims and concerns about organ trafficking.\n\nCan you tell me which summary you prefer?

From within Europe, Romanian nationals were the biggest group referred.\nThere are an estimated 92 organised crime groups in the UK with known involvement in human trafficking, it said.\nAnd 142 defendants were charged with offences related to human trafficking in 2011/12.\nBy Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News\nThe two potential victims of organ trafficking in the UK in 2011 are the first people identified as being forced into giving up their internal organs for transplant.\nBut it's still a small problem, with organ trafficking making up only 1% of all potential victims of trafficking last year, according to the Serious Organised Crime Association.\nCases of illegal organ trading are rare in the UK because of safeguards in place.\nThe Human Tissue Authority sees 1,200 cases a year of living organ donation - 95% involve kidneys and 5% liver lobes.\nThese cases include people making altruistic organ donations and those coming from abroad to donate organs to family members.\nThe HTA interviews all potential donors to make sure they are consenting freely and to ensure there is no reward or payment.\nThe process can take up to six months with the donor required to sign a form stating no coercion was involved.\nOnly when the HTA is satisfied would the operation be allowed to go ahead.\nAdvice is being drafted for NHS staff to help them identify potential cases of organ trafficking.\nThe report concluded intelligence sharing with international police forces was already \"proving effective\".\nImmigration minister Mark Harper said the results demonstrated UK professionals were getting better at \"spotting\" the crime due to \"cross-government\" cooperation.\n\"We're doing a better job of cracking down people involved in the vile trade,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live.\nBut the number of those prosecuted was \"not enough,\" he said.\n\"One of the things we do is to prosecute people for the most serious offences we can, and sometimes that's not a trafficking offence.\"\nMr Harper also said agencies needed to \"make sure victims who are trafficked are treated as victims and not as offenders, which has happened in the past\".\nDr Aidan McQuade, director of Anti-Slavery International, said Mr Harper \"must face up to the fact\" that the problem was worsening \"because of fundamental policy failures\".\nHe said the government viewed the problem \"through the lens of immigration\" and had allowed rights for migrant workers to slip from \"best practice\".\n\"It would be helpful if the government appointed a national commissioner on trafficking to make sure policy on this issue was unimpeded by politics.\"\nThe report revealed thousands of \"front-line\" workers, including border staff, police and healthcare workers, have been trained to better identify, support and protect victims over the past two years.\nSome airlines, including Virgin Atlantic and Thomas Cook, are also training cabin crew to identify those who engaged in trafficking and their potential victims.\nAnd a 24-hour confidential line has been set up for crew to report concerns to border officials before a plane lands in the UK.\n\nSummary1:\nThe UK is facing an increasing threat from trafficking gangs in China, Vietnam, Nigeria, and eastern Europe, with an increase in the number of victims and concerns about organ trafficking.\n\nSummary2:\nThe UK is facing a growing threat from human trafficking gangs, with 946 victims identified last year, and authorities are working to improve co-ordination and identification of victims.\n\nCan you tell me which summary you prefer?
