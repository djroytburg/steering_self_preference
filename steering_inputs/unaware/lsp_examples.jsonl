We don't know whether they received any other support.\n\"In the last few weeks of the campaign we've been running, we've been inundated with calls from parents who're in that situation and their child has been rejected from receiving a CAMHS service.\n\"They haven't been signposted anywhere else - that's a very worrying picture.\"\nCaitlin Wyllie-Quinn, 20, a student from Irvine, had a difficult transition to secondary school.\nBullying left her isolated and very down, crying all the time.\nShe got some initial help from the local Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service but after leaving therapy she went downhill rapidly.\nHer GP made another referral to CAMHS but this time it was rejected. Caitlin was told that because she was not suicidal or self-harming, her case was not serious enough.\n\"If the person doing the assessment had asked me if I was suicidal or self-harming I would have answered yes to both those questions, but basically I was refused help because they didn't have the capability to assess me properly,\" she said.\n\"I was at a real low point and I felt that getting referred to CAMHS was some sort of light at the end of the tunnel and finally maybe getting some help.\n\"For that to be stripped away from me made me feel even more worthless and just made things so much worse for me.\"\nThe NHS in Scotland provides mental health services for children and young people with a wide range of mental health problems including anxiety, behaviour problems, depression and early onset psychosis.\nThe Scottish government's mental health strategy commits it to carrying out reviews into school counselling and rejected child and adolescent mental health service referrals.\nIts mental health minister, Maureen Watt, said the reviews would happen \"soon\", and would allow improvements to be made to the system.\nMs Anderson said this was encouraging, but added: \"We really urge that to be quick and thorough because there are young people waiting now to get help and support.\n\"It might be that the CAMHS service isn't appropriate for them, but we simply don't know what the problem is.\"\nMeanwhile, statistics published on Tuesday also showed that a waiting time target for people to receive specialist mental health treatment has again been missed.\nThe Scottish government has had a target in place since 2014 for 90% of patients to be seen within 18 weeks of referral for mental health support.\nBut the target has never been met nationally - with the latest figures showing that 83.6% of children and adolescents, and 73.7% of adults, were seen within the required timescale between January and March of this year.\nAt the end of March, there were 6,932 children and young people across Scotland waiting for help from CAMHS, up from 6,359 at the end of December, according to the NHS statistics.\nAt the same time, there were 20,952 adults waiting for treatment, compared to 20,195 in December.\nAverage waiting times varied dramatically across the country, with 10 NHS boards meeting the target for CAMHS treatment but only three health boards meeting it for adult psychological care.\nThe figures also showed that 74 children and young people starting their treatment had been waiting more than a year to be seen.\nNHS Grampian met the waiting time target for just 45.2% of young people, while in NHS Lothian the target was met for 47.8% of youngsters\nAnd in the NHS Forth Valley area, only 40% of adults starting psychological treatment between January and March were seen within 18 weeks, with an average wait of 25 weeks.\nA spokesman for the Scottish Children's Services Coalition (SCSC) said research has suggested 10% of children aged between five and 16 have a clinically diagnosable mental health problem.\nPointing to a \"clear postcode lottery\" when it comes to treatment, he added: \"We are deeply concerned about what is happening to the more than a fifth of children and young people not accepted for treatment.\n\"There is a need for an urgent inquiry to ascertain why these young people are being rejected for treatment and what is happening to them.\"\nMs Watt, the mental health minster, said the number of health boards which had met the waiting time target for young people had increased from seven to 10 since the end of 2016.\nShe added: \"However, I'm clear that we must continue to reduce waiting times and I will not be satisfied until our target is met sustainably.\n\"Our recently published 10-year strategy for mental health sets out a range of measures that focus on prevention and early intervention to meet the mental health needs of children and young people, backed by \u00c2\u00a3150m of funding.\n\"We will also soon commission reviews into school counselling and rejected child and adolescent mental health service referrals, as a foundation for making further improvements.\"\n\nSummary1:\nOver 7,000 children and adolescents in Scotland had their mental health referrals rejected last year, with many left without support or alternative options, prompting calls for urgent action.\n\nSummary2:\nMore than 7,000 children and adolescents in Scotland had their mental health referrals rejected last year, prompting calls for urgent action to address the issue.\n\nCan you tell me which summary you prefer?

Caitlin was told that because she was not suicidal or self-harming, her case was not serious enough.\n\"If the person doing the assessment had asked me if I was suicidal or self-harming I would have answered yes to both those questions, but basically I was refused help because they didn't have the capability to assess me properly,\" she said.\n\"I was at a real low point and I felt that getting referred to CAMHS was some sort of light at the end of the tunnel and finally maybe getting some help.\n\"For that to be stripped away from me made me feel even more worthless and just made things so much worse for me.\"\nThe NHS in Scotland provides mental health services for children and young people with a wide range of mental health problems including anxiety, behaviour problems, depression and early onset psychosis.\nThe Scottish government's mental health strategy commits it to carrying out reviews into school counselling and rejected child and adolescent mental health service referrals.\nIts mental health minister, Maureen Watt, said the reviews would happen \"soon\", and would allow improvements to be made to the system.\nMs Anderson said this was encouraging, but added: \"We really urge that to be quick and thorough because there are young people waiting now to get help and support.\n\"It might be that the CAMHS service isn't appropriate for them, but we simply don't know what the problem is.\"\nMeanwhile, statistics published on Tuesday also showed that a waiting time target for people to receive specialist mental health treatment has again been missed.\nThe Scottish government has had a target in place since 2014 for 90% of patients to be seen within 18 weeks of referral for mental health support.\nBut the target has never been met nationally - with the latest figures showing that 83.6% of children and adolescents, and 73.7% of adults, were seen within the required timescale between January and March of this year.\nAt the end of March, there were 6,932 children and young people across Scotland waiting for help from CAMHS, up from 6,359 at the end of December, according to the NHS statistics.\nAt the same time, there were 20,952 adults waiting for treatment, compared to 20,195 in December.\nAverage waiting times varied dramatically across the country, with 10 NHS boards meeting the target for CAMHS treatment but only three health boards meeting it for adult psychological care.\nThe figures also showed that 74 children and young people starting their treatment had been waiting more than a year to be seen.\nNHS Grampian met the waiting time target for just 45.2% of young people, while in NHS Lothian the target was met for 47.8% of youngsters\nAnd in the NHS Forth Valley area, only 40% of adults starting psychological treatment between January and March were seen within 18 weeks, with an average wait of 25 weeks.\nA spokesman for the Scottish Children's Services Coalition (SCSC) said research has suggested 10% of children aged between five and 16 have a clinically diagnosable mental health problem.\nPointing to a \"clear postcode lottery\" when it comes to treatment, he added: \"We are deeply concerned about what is happening to the more than a fifth of children and young people not accepted for treatment.\n\"There is a need for an urgent inquiry to ascertain why these young people are being rejected for treatment and what is happening to them.\"\nMs Watt, the mental health minster, said the number of health boards which had met the waiting time target for young people had increased from seven to 10 since the end of 2016.\nShe added: \"However, I'm clear that we must continue to reduce waiting times and I will not be satisfied until our target is met sustainably.\n\"Our recently published 10-year strategy for mental health sets out a range of measures that focus on prevention and early intervention to meet the mental health needs of children and young people, backed by \u00c2\u00a3150m of funding.\n\"We will also soon commission reviews into school counselling and rejected child and adolescent mental health service referrals, as a foundation for making further improvements.\"\n\nSummary1:\nMore than 7,000 children and adolescents in Scotland had their mental health referrals rejected last year, prompting calls for urgent action to address the issue.\n\nSummary2:\nOver 7,000 children and adolescents in Scotland had their mental health referrals rejected last year, with many left without support or alternative options, prompting calls for urgent action.\n\nCan you tell me which summary you prefer?

Mr Drechsler argues that flexible working should no longer be seen as \"a bonus for staff\", but instead as something that also has clear benefits for employers.\nOther recommendations in the report include:\nThe report said data from earlier this month showing the UK's productivity still lags well behind other major economies meant employing a broader range of people was now more crucial than ever, and would help create more engaged employees.\n\"The economic and social challenges that the UK faces have been thrown into sharp relief by Brexit, in particular around issues like productivity, inclusion and opportunity,\" Mr Drechsler says.\n\"As businesses, it is up to us to seize the opportunities that exist to make some positive changes, becoming firms that will be competitive into the middle of the 21st century. If we get it right, business growth and greater opportunity will go hand in hand.\"\n\nSummary1:\nThe CBI encourages firms to offer flexible working in job ads to improve diversity and productivity, citing the success of Simmons & Simmons' flexible work policies.\n\nSummary2:\nThe CBI recommends that employers advertise flexible working options in job ads to attract a broader range of applicants and improve diversity, citing benefits for both employees and businesses.\n\nCan you tell me which summary you prefer?

The video, with its arresting imagery and impressive production values, is designed to electrify the group's followers.\nThe fact that Abu Safiyya is described as being from Chile merely adds to what the authors hope is now the organisation's global appeal.\nIsis said the Islamic state would extend from Aleppo in northern Syria to Diyala province in eastern Iraq.\nAbu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the group said, would become the leader of the state and would be known as \"Caliph Ibrahim\".\nIn the recording, the rebels also demanded that all Muslims \"pledge allegiance\" to the new ruler and \"reject democracy and other garbage from the West\".\nOn Sunday, Iraqi government jets struck at rebel positions and clashes broke out in various parts of Tikrit, witnesses and officials said.\n\"The security forces are advancing from different areas\", Lt-Gen Qassem Atta told journalists. \"There are ongoing clashes.\"\nTroops had reportedly pulled back to the nearby town of Dijla as Saturday's initial offensive met stiff resistance.\nThe heavy fighting over the two days caused many casualties on both sides, eyewitnesses and journalists told the BBC.\nInsurgents were reported to have shot down a helicopter and captured the pilot.\nMeanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called for the creation of an independent Kurdish state in response to gains made by Sunni insurgents in Iraq.\nIn a speech in Tel Aviv, he said the Kurds were \"a nation of fighters and have proved political commitment and are worthy of independence\".\nThe Kurds have long striven for an independent state but they remain divided between Syria and Turkey, Iran and Iraq.\nThe international community, including neighbouring Turkey and the US, remains opposed to the breakup of Iraq.\n\nSummary1:\nThe Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Isis) has declared the establishment of a caliphate, prompting Iraq's army to continue an offensive to retake the city of Tikrit.\n\nSummary2:\nThe Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Isis) declared the establishment of a caliphate, with Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as its leader, in a move rich with religious, cultural, and historic significance.\n\nCan you tell me which summary you prefer?
