After MPs rejected a Lords amendment for the second time, it's rumoured peers may drop their resistance to the Commons over benefits for disabled people in the \"Work Related Activities Group\", and content themselves with a \"regret\" motion. Then peers debate the Tax Credits (Income Thresholds and determination of Rates) Regulations 2016 - where the Lib Dems have put down another \"regret motion\" but seem unlikely to attract Labour support.\nAnd that's followed by an International Women's Day debate on the progress of women's representation and empowerment in the UK, 150 years after the 1866 petition for women's suffrage. There are 27 peers down to speak, including two notable maidens - the Conservative Baroness Mone and the Bishop of Gloucester, Rachel Treweek, who will become the first woman Bishop to speak in the Lords.\nThe Commons opens (11.30am) with Justice questions, followed at 12.30pm by a Ten Minute Rule Bill from the Conservative, Will Quince. He's calling for a first aid component to be added to the driving test, continuing the backbench campaign for more first aid training which recently saw a private member's bill which attempted to require First Aid to be taught in schools.\nHe says this would substantially increase the number of Britons with knowledge of first aid - countries like Germany, Switzerland and the Czech Republic already require evidence of first aid training as a condition of having a full driving licence. Mr Quince claims the support of the British Red Cross and St John's Ambulance.\nAfter that, MPs turn to detailed consideration of the Enterprise Bill - Labour and the Green MP Dr Caroline Lucas both have amendments down on the proposed privatisation of the Green Investment Bank, set up under the Coalition; Labour want to preserve its environmental objectives in the private sector, while Dr Lucas wants buyers to commit themselves to maintaining its existing programme.\nAnd there is a series of amendments on the bill's proposal to cap redundancy payments for public sector workers.\nThere will also be a backbench debate to mark International Women's Day, led by the former Cabinet Minister Maria Miller, now chair of the Women and Equalities Committee - the motion calls for more progress in electing women to Parliament, pay parity between men and women and more action against FGM.\nIn Westminster Hall, the opening debate led by the SNP's Dr Lisa Cameron is on puppy farming and the welfare of young dogs bred for sale (9am-11am).  Then Labour's Jo Cox raises the issue of autism diagnosis waiting times - she says many parents are waiting over two years to get an autism diagnosis for their child and says the families should have a diagnosis within a reasonable timeframe.\nAnd at 2.30pm-4pm, the Conservative Simon Hart will lead a debate on the potential economic benefits of the Swansea Tidal Lagoon - a \u00c2\u00a31bn green energy project, which is one of several such schemes proposed along the south coast of Wales. He will seek to explore the likely impact on the local economy and the number of permanent jobs created in Wales - especially if the Newport and Cardiff Schemes come on line. Early predications refer to a \u00c2\u00a320bn inward investment, nearly 2,000 new jobs and an unquantifiable impact on tourism and leisure.\nIn the Lords (2.30pm) there's an International Woman's Day flavour to question time, with questions on: the UN framework preventing violence against women, gender inequality, discriminatory practices and harmful cultural and social norms, from Baroness Kinnock; improving the reading skills of 16 to 24-year-old women, from Baroness Rebuck and on increasing the representation of women in political and public life, from Baroness Gale.\nThen peers turn to the detail of the Housing and Planning Bill - in the fourth day of seven of committee stage - and already the debate is lagging well behind schedule, raising the prospect that the bill might not get to its report stage immediately after Easter, as planned.\nThe sections under scrutiny on Tuesday include right to buy for tenants of housing association properties and high value council property sales. This is the a contentious part of the bill - but, as usual, committee stage debates are preliminary sparring, and no votes are expected; but the debates will foreshadow amendments for report stage, when a serious attempt to re-write these provisions looks likely.\nThere will also be a short debate on a political solution to the civil war in Syria- led by the Bishop of Coventry.\nThe Commons meets at 11.30am - for half an hour of questions to the ministers at the Cabinet Office, the government's \"engine room,\" followed, at noon by questions to the prime minister.\nPlaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts has a Ten Minute Rule Bill calling for the law on cyber-crime to be brought together from around 30 different statutes, and for new duties to be imposed on internet service providers and social media companies, to remove offensive material.\nShe has cross party support and this looks very much like the start of a campaign, rather in the tradition of her predecessor, Elfyn Llywd, who scored significant success in toughening up the law on stalking.\nThen MPs move on to the detail of the Enterprise Bill - where the crunch vote will be on an amendment, spearheaded by Tory backbencher David Burrowes, and signed by 22 Conservatives, to delete the government's proposals to loosen restrictions on Sunday trading.\nLabour will be whipped to back it, the Northern Ireland DUP is on board - but it looks as if the SNP will not be. There's also an amendment from the former Cabinet Minister Caroline Spellman which would allow a limited relaxation in Sunday opening hours for larger shops.\nThe day's Westminster Hall debates cover BT service standards (9.30am-11am); the government's proposals on fixed recoverable costs in clinical negligence claims (11am-11.30am); the contribution of the Scotch whisky industry to the UK economy (2.30pm-4pm); the management of the Health and Safety Executive (4pm- 4.30pm) and competition in the UK energy market (4.30-5.30pm).\nIn the Lords (3pm) peers launch into the report stage of the Immigration Bill, where votes are expected on amendments dealing with overseas domestic workers and permission to work for asylum seekers. Watch out, too, for an amendment from Lords Alton and Forsyth, and Baroness Cox, to guarantee asylum for people fleeing genocide, as defined in the International Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide; and from Lord Dubs, to allow for asylum for people employed by the UK Government in Iraq or Afghanistan.\nThe really big clash over this bill, on unaccompanied child migrants, will come the following week - unless the government makes a pre-emptive concession.\nThere will be a lot of interest on the debate on the report from the special committee set up to examine the impact on trade union political funds and (Labour) party funding (the Burns Report, after the crossbench peer who chaired the committee).\nThe Committee suggested a number of fixes which would reduce the impact of the current proposals in the Trade Union Bill - which have been denounced as a partisan attack by the government on Labour.\nThis will be the first chance to debate them and to get a response from ministers. And the committee report will tee up a series of amendments when the bill comes to report stage, on Wednesday 16 March. Opposition parties are waiting to see the colour of the minister's money on this issue - but even if the government signs up to the Burns Report compromise, there's still plenty left in this bill to argue about - not insisting on postal ballots and allowing e-voting for union ballots, the \"check-off\" system for deducting union subs from pay-packets, facility time for union reps and much more.\nThe various sides are still circling each other and we could still see a long drawn-out bout of trench warfare when report stage commences.\nThe Commons opens (9.30am) with Transport questions, followed by the weekly Business Statement from the Leader of the House, Chris Grayling. He will be under considerable pressure to announce the dates of forthcoming parliamentary recesses, and of the next Queen's Speech. MPs are particularly keen to know whether there will be a recess covering the EU Referendum and whether the the start of the next parliamentary year will be put back until after the referendum, implying a State Opening ceremony in July.\nThen MPs turn to the report stage and third reading of the Northern Ireland (Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan) Bill 2015-16, which implements the latest deal on the powers of the Northern Ireland Assembly. The scheduling implies that the powers that be don't expect any great controversy over this measure, and that the debate will be fairly brief.\nThe decision to end the centuries-old practice of recording Acts of Parliament on vellum - treated cow skin - will be raised in a Backbench Business Committee debate. James Gray, a member of the House of Commons Commission, which signed up to that decision (which came from the Lords) wants to carry on using vellum - and it may all come down to how much it would cost to keep it, and who pays.\nIn the Lords (from 11am) peers debate the detailed provisions on \"pay to stay\" and ending secure tenancies, in the Housing and Planning Bill (see Tuesday, above).\nThere will also be a short debate on the renewal of the BBC's Charter, led by the Liberal Democrat Baroness Bonham-Carter. As I write there are 16 peers are down to speak, which is quite a turnout for a short debate on a Thursday - suggesting there's a considerable level of interest in this issue in the Upper House.\nThe Commons meets (9.30am) to debate private members' bills - I'll list what's down on the Order Paper at the moment, but it's an increasingly inaccurate guide to what actually happens on the day. The main reason for this is that we're now approaching the end of the parliamentary year, where cunning operators like the wily Peter Bone angle to get second reading debate on issues they want to raise - although they then have little prospect of becoming law.\nBut the announcement of the date of the EU referendum has put Mr Bone, one of the prime movers in the increasingly important Grassroots Out organisation, into campaign mode, and he has not been able to be in the Chamber to move some of the many bills he has put down for debate.\nHis close ally, Christopher Chope, has stepped into the breach to move some of those bills - specialising in the ones with an EU dimension. But sadly we're unlikely to get a debate on the Prime Minister (Temporary Appointment) Bill, which would have provided a mechanism, in case the PM was run over by a bus.\nFor the record, the current batting order is:  Foreign National Offenders (Exclusion from the UK) Bill (Peter Bone); National Health Service Bill (Caroline Lucas); Criminal Cases Review Commission (Supplementary Powers) Bill (Andy McDonald); Regulation of Enforcement Agents (Collection of Council Tax Arrears) Bill (Yvonne Fovargue); Health Services Commissioning (Equality and Accountability) (No. 2) Bill (Rehman Chishti); Perinatal Mental Illness (NHS Family Services) Bill (Rehman Chishti); Scotland Act 1998 (Amendment) Bill (Angus Brendan MacNeil) and the House of Lords (Parliamentary Standards Etc) Bill (Sir Edward Leigh).\nThere are many more bills listed, and if some of those above are not moved, they may even be debated - if their movers are there to do so.\nIt's also private members' bill day in the Lords (10am) where peers will consider the Gambling (Categorisation and Use of B2 Gaming Machines) Bill and the Criminal Cases Review Commission (Information) Bill.

It's important for me to select the better summary for my records.\n\nArticle:\nBritish Gas unveiled a 5.1% price reduction, followed swiftly by EDF's announcement of a 5% cut.\nBritish Gas's price change takes effect on 16 March, while EDF's kicks in eight days later.\nThe moves benefit customers on a standard domestic gas tariff.\nBritain's big six energy suppliers have been under pressure to pass on savings to customers after a 57% drop in wholesale gas prices since this time last year.\nE.On was the first to announce a cut this year of 5.1%, followed by similar reductions by SSE, Scottish Power and Npower.\nExecutive director at consumer group Which?, Richard Lloyd, said :\"Seeing all of the big suppliers mirror each other with small cuts in the face of falling wholesale prices will raise questions in many people's minds about whether competition is working in this market.\"\nBritish Gas, which is owned by Centrica, said 6.8 million of its customers on dual-fuel deals would see an average annual saving of \u00c2\u00a331 due to the 5.1% cut.\nIt said customers on so-called \"fix and fall\" tariffs would also benefit from the price reduction.\nEDF said about 900,000 of its customers would also make an annual saving of \u00c2\u00a331.\nIt said it had no exit fees on any of its fixed deals.\nBeatrice Bigois, managing director of customers at EDF, said: \"Our prices are under constant review and today's announcement reflects falls in wholesale gas costs.\"\nCentrica's Mark Hodges, chief executive of its energy supply and services in UK and Ireland, said: \"Competitive pricing is the way to retain existing customers and win new business in this hard-fought market.\"\nSome commentators warn that these types of \"standard\" tariffs are among the most expensive, so there is still benefit in shopping around.\nRachel Fletcher, Ofgem's senior partner for consumers and competition, said: \"These price cuts are a movement in the right direction for loyal customers, but they are dwarfed by the savings available by switching from a standard tariff to a fixed deal.\n\"You could save more money, up to \u00c2\u00a3300, by switching.\"\nThere was also criticism of the industry for failing to cut electricity tariffs, despite falling wholesale costs.\nEnergy analysts at Jefferies said: \"There has still been no movement in electricity tariffs, despite a 30% fall in wholesale electricity prices since August 2014.\n\"This is likely due to increased environmental costs, which fall on electricity rather than gas, and additional network charges.\"\nBritish Gas said it was unable to lower electricity prices due to rising costs, such as for network delivery, adding that wholesale costs only make up a third of electricity bills.\nEnergy and Climate Change Secretary Amber Rudd said there was still more to do.\nSuppliers are awaiting the outcome of a competition watchdog investigation set to conclude in June, which Ms Rudd said would help determine if consumers were getting a \"rough deal\".\n\nSummary1:\nBritish Gas and EDF have announced price reductions for gas, but critics argue that electricity tariffs should also be cut due to falling wholesale costs.\n\nSummary2:\nBritish Gas and EDF have announced 5.1% and 5% price reductions respectively, benefiting standard domestic gas tariff customers with average annual savings of \u00a331.\n\nCan you tell me which summary you prefer?

I said 'I'm going nowhere'. Then she said 'Why are you selling the house then? I've seen it on Rightmove'.\n\"I didn't know what to think. I felt terrible. I felt scared.\"\nMr To logged on to the website to find the advert featured several pictures of his home and was inviting bids starting at \u00a3300,000.\nThe details even included a request that the tenants were \"not to be disturbed\".\nPolice later discovered Ghani and Mahmood carried out the fraud after stealing three utility bills from Mr To's mailbox.\nHaving forged his signature, they then transferred the deeds to his house into Ghani's name.\nThey put the property up for auction in the hope it would sell quickly, without the need for estate agents to show people around.\nMr To discovered the advert just three days before the auction was due to commence.\nThe court heard Ghani had carried out a similar fraud targeting a couple in Bolton, using fraudulent passports to transfer the deeds to their \u00a3300,000 house into his name.\nWorking with Ramanauskaite, he also took out driving licences in the names of a couple from Salford, before stealing their savings of \u00a390,000.\nRamanauskaite, 30, of Spring Street, Bury, also admitted conspiracy to defraud and was sentenced to 14 months, suspended for two years, and ordered to carry out 250 hours in unpaid work.\nBecause Mr To had paid off his mortgage, the men were able to transfer the deeds without needing the extra authority of the lender.\nHe believes the rules need tightening before more people are targeted.\n\"It's very simple. The government should make it the law that if you're going to change the land registry deeds you should need two signatures,\" Mr To said.\nDet Sgt Phil Larratt, of Greater Manchester Police, said: \"As this case demonstrates, fraudsters can use your identity details to open new bank accounts, request new driving licences and even try and steal your own home.\n\"We urge the public to secure their mail boxes and employ measures to protect their identities.\"\n\nSummary1:\nTwo men have been jailed for stealing mail and forging signatures to auction off a man's home, prompting calls for tighter regulations to prevent similar fraud.\n\nSummary2:\nTwo men, Saeed Ghani and Atif Mahmood, have been jailed for their roles in a scam that saw them steal a homeowner's mail, forge his signature, and auction his \u00a3300,000 house on Rightmove.\n\nCan you tell me which summary you prefer?

{"id": "38735486", "prompt": "Here are two news-article summaries I found. It's important for me to select the better summary for my records.\n\nArticle:\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nIt's 1997 and ID7 television are filming at Dunkirk rugby club in northern France. Their subject is in his mid-30s, has a full head of hair and is strangely familiar. He's not French, but he's fluent. Only when the cameraman asks him to say his name does the penny drop.\n\"Je m'appelle Vernon Anthony Cotter.\"\nFor four and a half minutes he doesn't miss a beat - and why would he? Cotter had been in the country for years by then. Four seasons playing in the back row with Rumilly in the south-east, two years with Lourdes in the foothills of the Pyrenees, a year with Saint-Junien in west-central France and he would soon kick on for the small southern village of Castelnau-Riviere-Basse, where he played and coached while briefly contemplating a new life as a winemaker.\nCotter is now sitting in Murrayfield talking about the past, the present, the future. The New Zealander has been Scotland coach for 31 Test matches - 16 victories, 15 defeats, nine of which were by seven points or less, five of them by three or less.\nHe's given a first cap to 26 players. Eighteen of the squad he has just named for the Six Nations have appeared on his watch.\nHe has just five more Tests before France reclaims him. Montpellier await. Time for reflection, then. Time to remember where Cotter came from and where he has taken Scotland in his two and a half eventful years.\nCotter is big into culture. Rugby culture. He learned about it first as a player with Counties in New Zealand but a lot of his knowledge came in those early years in France. \"I used to think I was a reasonably physical player, but I was a baby,\" he says.\nI understand New Zealanders so much more after living in Scotland because a lot of the influence comes from here\n\"I learned a lot about character and defending the jersey. You couldn't help but get swept away. The French flair - I used to laugh at that. It wasn't true. Overlaps were created because two forward packs were generally having a good whack at each other.\"\nHe tells a story about a derby match from the mid-90s, his own Lourdes team versus Pau. No love lost between them. In their previous meeting there'd been \"scuffles\" and Lourdes had come off second best.\n\"Our players were doing cartwheels going on to the paddock,\" Cotter recounts. \"The coach said, 'Right boys, tactics for the day. The first five [eighth] kick it straight into the stand and we run up and punch them.' That's what happened. I had somebody who had given me a gentle tickle in the away game and I managed to line him up.\n\"There was an all-out brawl, but no penalty. We had a scrum in midfield and our locks came through and caressed the opposition front row a little bit with their hands. A couple of them needed treatment and we scored a try from there. It was an insight.\n\"It wasn't just a game. I enjoyed the fact that you were playing for your town and your colours. They could be absolute psychopaths on the paddock and gentlemen afterwards.\"\nYears later, while coaching at Clermont, Cotter was given a nickname - les yeux de glace ('eyes of ice'). Years after that, in Scotland, he was christened Stern Vern. To understand what makes him tick, the period of his life in a country where he's already done 17 years, and where he will soon return for another three, is important.\nEight seasons at Clermont turned Cotter into one of the hottest coaching tickets in world rugby. The season before he took over, the club finished a poor eighth in the French championship. In his first year - and for the three years that followed - they made the final.\nIn 2010 they won the first league title in their history. Cotter - with his great friend Joe Schmidt as assistant coach - had become immortal in the French game.\nClermont were never out of the top four on Cotter's watch. Then, the move to Scotland. Not a lot of people in France could understand why he did it. Going to New Zealand, they would have understood. England, they could get. Ireland, perhaps. But Scotland?\n\"It's something that I didn't have to do, it's something that we wanted to do as a family,\" he explains.\n\"One of the key motivating factors was that people [in France] would take the mickey out of Scotland and its rugby. It sort of upset me. I was defending the underdog.\n\"Before the Six Nations, everybody would take a sweepstake and Scotland was always last pick.\n\"Look, I remember the 1990s. I remember Scotland coming to New Zealand [in the summer of 1990] and they should have beaten the All Blacks. We weren't inventing the game, Scotland were doing it. When we first came together as a squad we looked at some footage of those days. They were brave, confident warriors.\n\"Trying to bring that back to Scotland was one of the key things. They [Jim Telfer and Ian McGeechan, the coaches of the era] were ahead of their time. Any comparison to those two great men is very nice. I would take inspiration from what they did. The game has moved on but some of the essential things they were coaching are still relevant, especially to the Scottish psyche.\n\"Scotland has a proud history. It's a humble country and it's a place you can become attached to very quickly.\"\nIn Cotter's first Six Nations, in 2015, Scotland got whitewashed, Wooden-spooned and, at times, embarrassed. Last season brought progression. The brilliance and pain of the near-miss against Australia in the World Cup, the home win against France in the Six Nations, the fact - incredible as it seems - that 2016 was the first time in the 17-year history of the competition that Scotland managed to score more points than they conceded, and hit double figures for tries scored.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nScotland have become an exciting team. More than at any point since last winning the championship under Telfer in 1999, they're posing a threat to the big nations.\n\"The principal foundations are mindset and skill-set,\" says Cotter. \"It was about creating clarity.\n\"The other thing is leadership, creating a leadership group so that they determine behaviour and standards because it's always much easier when you have a group that can think on its feet, that's autonomous. I think that's where we're getting.\n\"You've got a team that's experienced some good things and some bad things. We've become aware of what we can do. Winning is the most important thing. So how do we win? We go through a painful process of learning how to win.\n\"There's been improvement. Would we have liked quicker improvement? Yeah, we probably would. Would we have liked to nail some of those close games? Yes. But we've used them as benchmarks.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nOn the opening day of the Six Nations, Ireland come to Edinburgh. \"We played them at the end of the competition in the last two years and their strength in depth showed through,\" Cotter recalls.\n\"We have more depth now to stay a bit more robust until the end. I'd like to think this game will be closer than those two.\n\"It's a really big challenge for our guys. Joe [Schmidt, Ireland coach] is a really good friend and we'll probably have a beer afterwards. Unfortunately, he's always the one with the smile on his face - and I'd like it to stop. I'd like to get one back on him.\"\nBeyond that, it's a trip to France, then a visit from Wales, then a journey down to England. Scotland have moved forward, but that's no guarantee of victories in the coming weeks.\n\"We know that these teams are very good,\" he insists. \"When they see us on the fixture list they know they're going in as favourites, very confident that they'll beat us. It's our job to try to surprise them somehow, to have something that will take them away from the comfort zone and create errors in their game that we can exploit.\"\nFive more games and then he's away. It's not the way he planned it. It's just the way it is, he says.\nWhen the news broke that this was going to be Cotter's final Six Nations, an audible gasp could have been heard around Scottish rugby. There had been little hint of it, no suggestion his time was coming to an end.\nHe would have preferred to stay on, but Gregor Townsend was ready for an elevation and there was only one way that was going to happen.\nWill he miss it? \"Undoubtedly, but we'll come back on holiday,\" he says. \"You never know, you might find that Glasgow are in Montpellier's pool next year in European rugby.\n\"It was always going to be the deal. The SRU had made it known at the outset that they'd like a Scottish coach in the national position sooner or later and I respect entirely the decision. Would I have liked to continue? Yeah, probably would have, but that's the way it is.\"\nCotter, without doubt, has been good for Scotland but he says Scotland has been good for him, too.\n\"I understand New Zealanders so much more after living in Scotland because a lot of the influence comes from here,\" he explains. \"I recognise it in our rural communities.\n\"I'm not an extroverted person - I'm introverted, I'm quiet - and I love the countryside, I love what Scotland has got to offer, whether it's the coastline, the mountains, the rivers. I enjoyed my time in Colonsay, fishing on the west coast in Plockton, stalking in Glen Shiel.\n\"We've got some good friends in the Borders who love their rugby and it's nice to see their passion. They talk about passion in France, but there's some real passion here for the game.\n\"It's been a privilege, the whole thing. I've only got fond memories. I move on. The game has existed in this country for over a hundred years and it will exist long after I've left. There's another project to move to after I finish here. We were going to go back to New Zealand but then Montpellier came up. They wanted something constructed and the communication I had with the president convinced me that there was perhaps another adventure to take on.\"\nMore than anything he wants to exit on a high. In the coming weeks he says he wants the team to deliver moments that will bond them together not just in the here and now but for decades down the road.\n\"They give everything, these guys,\" he adds. \"They're striving to give people something to be proud of.

Temperatures were expected to reach up to 44C in some areas.\nIn Seville, some people jumped off bridge to swim in the city's Guadalquivir river to try and escape the heat, according to AFP.\nSpain's Guardia Civil urged people to drink at least three litres (five pints) of water a day and to avoid eating hot meals.\nThe heatwave is expected to spread, prompting concern in France and in the UK.\nIn 2003, a heatwave led to 70,000 more deaths than usual across Europe.\n\"I don't think this heatwave will have the same consequences as the one in 2003 because we weren't as prepared at that time,\" said French Ecology Minister Segolene Royal.\nThe high temperatures are expected to last at least until the end of the week.\nThe body's normal core temperature is 37-38C.\nIf it heats up to 39-40C, the brain tells the muscles to slow down and fatigue sets in. At 40-41C heat exhaustion is likely - and above 41C the body starts to shut down.\nChemical processes start to be affected, the cells inside the body deteriorate and there is a risk of multiple organ failure.\nThe body cannot even sweat at this point because blood flow to the skin stops, making it feel cold and clammy.\nHeatstroke - which can occur at any temperature over 40C - requires professional medical help and if not treated immediately, chances of survival can be slim.\nThere are a number of things people can do to help themselves. These include:\nWhat happens to the body in extreme heat?\nEight low-tech ways to keep cool in a heatwave\n\nSummary1:\nSpain and Portugal issue heatwave warnings as temperatures soar, posing high risk of forest fires and prompting concerns in France and the UK.\n\nSummary2:\nA severe heatwave has hit Spain and Portugal, prompting red and orange alerts, with temperatures expected to reach up to 44C and increasing the risk of forest fires and heat-related illnesses.\n\nCan you tell me which summary you prefer?

But it's rarely as speedy as in Natalie Bennett's case.\nThe Australian-born former Guardian journalist woke up on New Year's Day 2006 and decided she wanted to do something to change the world.\nAfter pondering her options (should she get involved with an NGO or the UN?) she joined the Green Party. Within six short years she had become its leader.\nThree years after that she was sharing a stage with the prime minister and other party leaders in a televised general election debate.\nHer sudden arrival on the frontline of British politics was all the more remarkable because she had never won an election, other than the one that had made her party leader.\nHer first aim when she took on the job was to insert the Green Party - routinely ignored or patronised by the mainstream media - into the national conversation.\nBut when media outlets finally began calling, on the back of a surge in support for the party, she sometimes found it difficult to get her message across in a suitably snappy way.\nHer vision for the party was to show how \"economic and environmental justice are indivisible\", she explains, \"the idea that tackling environmental problems isn't an add-on luxury\".\nIt was \"not a easy concept to get across\", she confesses. \"I still don't think I've got the 12 second soundbite.

And I guess I get tangled up in my desire to answer a question, even when it's a really stupid question\".\nDid she get asked a lot of stupid questions?\n\"Yes.\"\nAsked for an example, she ponders for a minute, before highlighting an interview with the BBC's very own John Humphrys, which led to her having \"to spend time, valuable peak time, explaining how the interviewer got the question wrong. And listeners don't particularly like that because it's all technical and boring and you are arguing with the interviewer but if it's entirely on the wrong track you have to\".\nShe says she has some sympathy with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has also attracted criticism for broadcast interviews in which he has deviated from the usual prepared soundbites.\n\"The focus on the individual is a problem for British politics and it's very uncomfortable when the focus is on you,\" she says, arguing that the media in continental Europe are focused more on policies than personalities and trivia.\n\"I am not complaining - you have to work within those limits,\" she adds, but she believes British politics is \"broken\" and the media must take its share of the blame.\n\"There should be some pressure on the journalist to ask better, more sensible questions,\" she argues.\nThere was nothing particularly stupid about the question that prompted her darkest moment in a radio studio, however, when she struggled over several excruciating minutes, punctuated by coughing fits, to answer a question from LBC's Nick Ferrari on her party's housing policy.\nShe was quick to hold her hands up afterwards, apologising to supporters and blaming her sub-par performance, in the heat of the general election campaign, on \"brain freeze\".\n\"That was a very tough moment. And of course you take a bit of a punch to the stomach.\n\"But then a few weeks later I was up on the leader debates, able to look David Cameron in the eye and challenge him about his failure to welcome Syrian refugees to Britain, and that was one of the best moments.\n\"My great problem on that day was that I was in no way well enough to actually be doing anything. I'd had about three and a half hours sleep and I'd been throwing up most of the night.

The Green Party fielded a record number of general election candidates in 2015, standing in 93% of constituencies, and gaining more than a million votes.

She believes the case for scrapping what she sees as Britain's outdated first-past-the-post electoral system is gaining ground in the country.\nShe says she has had an \"amazing\" four years as leader, and has no regrets, believing the party is in better shape now, having quadrupled its membership and gained a foothold in the national debate on issues such as welfare and the economy, than when she took over.\nBut she is also keen to stress that she will not be leaving politics.\n\"I'm aiming to turn former leader into a role in its own right, to keep travelling the country, supporting local parties, doing media.

Prisoners in UK jails can volunteer for the treatment.\nThe new laws also allow judges to sentence paedophiles to death or tag them electronically, and applies a 10-year minimum sentence for child sex crimes.\nHuman rights groups including the National Commission for Women (NCW) criticised the laws and called for them to be re-evaluated each year to test whether they are a deterrent.\nAzriana, the head of the NCW, said: \"Other countries that have chemical castration have not seen a reduction in sexual crime against children. Also it's a very expensive procedure and what we should be spending and investing our money in is services to support and help the victims.\"\nDr Yohana Susana Yembise, Indonesia's Minister for Women Empowerment and Child Protection, said the administration was \"praying\" that the punishments \"will have the desired effect\".\nShe said: \"Now we have the harshest punishments: the death penalty, life in prison, chemical castration, the public naming of perpetrators and the electronic chip. These are now law, so even if you hate the idea of them everyone now has to support this.\"\nThe punishments follow a number of high profile cases of child sexual abuse in the country. Last year, a British-Canadian teacher and an Indonesian were jailed for 10 years for sexually abusing three children at a Jakarta kindergarten.\nAnd earlier this year, the body of a nine-year-old girl was found in a cardboard box in Jakarta after she had been repeatedly sexually assaulted and killed.\n\nSummary1:\nPresident Joko Widodo's proposed laws in Indonesia include chemical castration and the death penalty for paedophiles, sparking debate and opposition from human rights groups.\n\nSummary2:\nIndonesia's new laws allow for harsher punishments, including chemical castration, death, and electronic tagging, for child sex crimes in response to high-profile cases of abuse.\n\nCan you tell me which summary you prefer?

This had been built through the EU years and growing networks of international partnerships.\nHe described Brexit for universities as the \"Manchester United problem\".\nWhy would any football team with international ambitions deliberately want to restrict its access both to better talent and to bigger markets?\nThere were warnings about the financial impact of losing European research funding.\nThe UK's universities are among the biggest winners from Horizon 2020 research network, bringing more than \u00c2\u00a32bn into the higher education sector.\nThis is no small-bi\u00c3\u00a8re, with some individual universities worrying about the loss of hundreds of millions.\nIf the UK is to stay ahead in research, Dr Anne Corbett of the LSE said the UK government had to be ready for some \"serious funding\".\nProfessor Stephanie Haywood, president of the Engineering Professors' Council, warned that losing access to EU students would make skills shortages in engineering even worse.\nBut could there be an upside in higher tuition fees?\nIf EU students are designated as overseas students after Brexit, UK universities could charge them much higher fees.\nBut such a tuition fee windfall depends on those students not staying at home or going somewhere else.\nProf Barnard raised the example of those talented eastern European mathematicians.\nWould they really be able to pay \u00c2\u00a317,000 or so a year? Or would it mean that universities in the UK would have pay for scholarships rather than see them go elsewhere?\nCommittee chairman Neil Carmichael pushed his witnesses for more evidence and facts.\nBut what came back most often was even more questions. What's going to happen to the EU staff in UK universities? What will be the visa system for students?\nWhat will happen to the intricate networks of European research? How much will the UK government be willing to cover for any lost income?\nAnd of course, so far, these are unknowns being piled up on unknowables.\nBut as another European refugee scientist, Albert Einstein, once said: \"If we knew what we were doing, it wouldn't be called research.\"\n\nSummary1:\nUK universities are warning that Brexit poses a grim prospect for higher education and research, with potential losses of EU students, staff, and funding, threatening the sector's global competitiveness.\n\nSummary2:\nBrexit poses a grim prospect for UK universities, with warnings of decreased applications from EU students, potential loss of research talent, and financial impact from losing European research funding.\n\nCan you tell me which summary you prefer?

This had been built through the EU years and growing networks of international partnerships.\nHe described Brexit for universities as the \"Manchester United problem\".\nWhy would any football team with international ambitions deliberately want to restrict its access both to better talent and to bigger markets?\nThere were warnings about the financial impact of losing European research funding.\nThe UK's universities are among the biggest winners from Horizon 2020 research network, bringing more than \u00c2\u00a32bn into the higher education sector.\nThis is no small-bi\u00c3\u00a8re, with some individual universities worrying about the loss of hundreds of millions.\nIf the UK is to stay ahead in research, Dr Anne Corbett of the LSE said the UK government had to be ready for some \"serious funding\".\nProfessor Stephanie Haywood, president of the Engineering Professors' Council, warned that losing access to EU students would make skills shortages in engineering even worse.\nBut could there be an upside in higher tuition fees?\nIf EU students are designated as overseas students after Brexit, UK universities could charge them much higher fees.\nBut such a tuition fee windfall depends on those students not staying at home or going somewhere else.\nProf Barnard raised the example of those talented eastern European mathematicians.\nWould they really be able to pay \u00c2\u00a317,000 or so a year? Or would it mean that universities in the UK would have pay for scholarships rather than see them go elsewhere?\nCommittee chairman Neil Carmichael pushed his witnesses for more evidence and facts.\nBut what came back most often was even more questions. What's going to happen to the EU staff in UK universities? What will be the visa system for students?\nWhat will happen to the intricate networks of European research? How much will the UK government be willing to cover for any lost income?\nAnd of course, so far, these are unknowns being piled up on unknowables.\nBut as another European refugee scientist, Albert Einstein, once said: \"If we knew what we were doing, it wouldn't be called research.\"\n\nSummary1:\nBrexit poses a grim prospect for UK universities, with warnings of decreased applications from EU students, potential loss of research talent, and financial impact from losing European research funding.\n\nSummary2:\nUK universities are warning that Brexit poses a grim prospect for higher education and research, with potential losses of EU students, staff, and funding, threatening the sector's global competitiveness.\n\nCan you tell me which summary you prefer?

It's important for me to select the better summary for my records.\n\nArticle:\nHe would go upstairs, on the premise that he was saying a prayer with his niece, then sexually abuse her.\nNow in her 30s, Karen wasn't understood when she first told her parents what her uncle, Mark Sewell, was doing.\nSewell was also the son of a trusted older member of the local Jehovah's Witnesses congregation, known as an elder.\nChristian churches, as well as other religions, have faced claims of child abuse.\nBut what is striking about the Jehovah's Witnesses is their explicit policy of dealing with abuse in-house.\nBecause of their practice of following the Bible literally, they insist there must be two witnesses to a crime, often not the case in child abuse cases.\nHowever, in Karen's case a second witness did come forward: Wendy, a family friend and fellow member of the Barry congregation in south Wales. She had been raped by the same man.\nWhen she reported the crime to elders, Wendy was made to describe it in minute detail to a group of older men.\nLater, she had to give her account again in the same room as Sewell.\nAfterwards, the elders told her that as it was only her account against that of Sewell, nothing more could be done.\nThis bringing together of the accused and the accuser in a \"judicial committee\" is a common feature of Jehovah's Witnesses' justice.\nKaren, still a teenager at the time, was put through the process.\nThe elders also ruled that their separate accusations didn't constitute the required two witnesses.\nDespite a pattern of predatory sexual behaviour, it took more than two decades to bring Wendy and Karen's abuser to justice.\nHe is now serving a 14-year prison sentence.\nHis punishment from the Jehovah's Witnesses? There wasn't one.\nEven when the case came to court, the organisation was reluctant to co-operate.\nKaren's father, John Viney, who was also an elder in the Barry congregation, says that elders who knew of Sewell's conduct and were asked to give statements or evidence in court did not want to get involved.\nIn a programme for Radio 4's The Report, we have identified this lack of co-operation in several other similar cases.\nConfidential documents from the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of Britain - the official name for the Jehovah's Witnesses - that we have seen are explicit about the best way to deal with such matters being within the congregation.\nNowhere in the hundreds of pages we have seen are elders told that they must go to the police, even if the perpetrator confesses, unless state or national law makes it mandatory to report such allegations.\nThe Jehovah's Witnesses' UK leadership declined to talk to us for the programme.\nIn a statement, they said they were appealing against a recent High Court ruling in the UK that awarded substantial damages against the organisation for failing to protect a child from sexual abuse by a paedophile.\nTheir statement also insists that the organisation does take child abuse extremely seriously.\nKaren Morgan and Wendy are now pursuing a civil claim against the organisation, hoping that further financial penalty may force the leadership of the Jehovah's Witnesses to change its policies.\nFor both of them, what made it even harder was the sense that belonging to the Jehovah's Witnesses was part of an all-encompassing lifestyle, with members encouraged to socialise and marry within the group.\nThe organisation has some eight million members around the world, but as Karen found to her cost, those who decide to have a boyfriend or girlfriend who is not a member may find themselves \"disfellowshipped\" or shunned.\nJehovah's Witnesses are not the only religious organisation to try to deal with allegations of sexual abuse in-house.\nFor many decades, that was the preferred method of the Roman Catholic Church, which has since reformed its child safeguarding policies following numerous court cases in the US and Europe against priests for the sexual abuse of children.\nOther churches have also tightened up their child safeguarding policies, with the Methodist Church conducting its own recent inquiry into abuse allegations dating back to 1950.\nThat inquiry has led to calls for the Church of England to hold a fresh internal inquiry of its own, separately from the overarching national public inquiry that has just begun, and from the investigation it published in 2010, which critics termed inadequate.\nHowever, it is the more closed religious communities and new religious movements where it remains hardest for the victims of such abuse to speak out and gain access to secular justice, although awareness of the issue is growing.\nOnly this month, an ultra-Orthodox Jewish scholar from Manchester - who fled to Israel after he was exposed as a paedophile - was jailed for 13 years.\nTodros Grynhaus was deported by the Israeli authorities to face justice in the UK, with his conviction for sex offences against girls leading to a change in attitudes in the Haredi Jewish community.\nThe case prompted the UK's Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, to urge members to report child sex abuse.\nThe court had heard that both women who testified against Grynhaus in the case had been \"ostracised\" by their community as a result of speaking out about their ordeal.\nFor young Muslim girls, the price of speaking out about child sexual abuse can also be high, with many reluctant to report such abuse because of the fear that it would bring shame on them and their family.\nSexual and physical abuse at Islamic religious schools, known as madrassas, has also resulted in some prosecutions in recent years, although often victims still hesitate to come forward with such allegations.\nMany religious organisations will find themselves being closely scrutinised in the national independent inquiry into child sexual abuse,  chaired by New Zealand judge Lowell Goddard.\nThe survivors of such abuse hope that the inquiry will prove itself truly independent, and help ensure that abusers will not be able to rely on their own congregations or religious leaders to protect them - whatever their faith.\nThe Inquiry will investigate a wide range of institutions including:\nLocal authorities\nThe police\nThe Crown Prosecution Service\nThe Immigration Service\nThe BBC\nThe armed forces\nSchools\nHospitals\nChildren's homes\nChurches, mosques and other religious organisations\nCharities and voluntary organisations\nFull details of the inquiry\nCaroline Wyatt's investigation will be broadcast in Radio 4's The Report at 20:00 BST on Thursday, 23 July.\n\nSummary1:\nA Jehovah's Witnesses elder, Mark Sewell, was convicted of child abuse after a 20-year investigation, but the organization's in-house policy and lack of cooperation hindered justice for his victims.\n\nSummary2:\nThe Jehovah's Witnesses' explicit policy of dealing with abuse in-house, including the requirement of two witnesses to a crime, has led to delayed justice for victims.\n\nCan you tell me which summary you prefer?

the official name for the Jehovah's Witnesses - that we have seen are explicit about the best way to deal with such matters being within the congregation.\nNowhere in the hundreds of pages we have seen are elders told that they must go to the police, even if the perpetrator confesses, unless state or national law makes it mandatory to report such allegations.\nThe Jehovah's Witnesses' UK leadership declined to talk to us for the programme.\nIn a statement, they said they were appealing against a recent High Court ruling in the UK that awarded substantial damages against the organisation for failing to protect a child from sexual abuse by a paedophile.\nTheir statement also insists that the organisation does take child abuse extremely seriously.\nKaren Morgan and Wendy are now pursuing a civil claim against the organisation, hoping that further financial penalty may force the leadership of the Jehovah's Witnesses to change its policies.\nFor both of them, what made it even harder was the sense that belonging to the Jehovah's Witnesses was part of an all-encompassing lifestyle, with members encouraged to socialise and marry within the group.\nThe organisation has some eight million members around the world, but as Karen found to her cost, those who decide to have a boyfriend or girlfriend who is not a member may find themselves \"disfellowshipped\" or shunned.\nJehovah's Witnesses are not the only religious organisation to try to deal with allegations of sexual abuse in-house.\nFor many decades, that was the preferred method of the Roman Catholic Church, which has since reformed its child safeguarding policies following numerous court cases in the US and Europe against priests for the sexual abuse of children.\nOther churches have also tightened up their child safeguarding policies, with the Methodist Church conducting its own recent inquiry into abuse allegations dating back to 1950.\nThat inquiry has led to calls for the Church of England to hold a fresh internal inquiry of its own, separately from the overarching national public inquiry that has just begun, and from the investigation it published in 2010, which critics termed inadequate.\nHowever, it is the more closed religious communities and new religious movements where it remains hardest for the victims of such abuse to speak out and gain access to secular justice, although awareness of the issue is growing.\nOnly this month, an ultra-Orthodox Jewish scholar from Manchester - who fled to Israel after he was exposed as a paedophile - was jailed for 13 years.\nTodros Grynhaus was deported by the Israeli authorities to face justice in the UK, with his conviction for sex offences against girls leading to a change in attitudes in the Haredi Jewish community.\nThe case prompted the UK's Chief Rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, to urge members to report child sex abuse.\nThe court had heard that both women who testified against Grynhaus in the case had been \"ostracised\" by their community as a result of speaking out about their ordeal.\nFor young Muslim girls, the price of speaking out about child sexual abuse can also be high, with many reluctant to report such abuse because of the fear that it would bring shame on them and their family.\nSexual and physical abuse at Islamic religious schools, known as madrassas, has also resulted in some prosecutions in recent years, although often victims still hesitate to come forward with such allegations.\nMany religious organisations will find themselves being closely scrutinised in the national independent inquiry into child sexual abuse,  chaired by New Zealand judge Lowell Goddard.\nThe survivors of such abuse hope that the inquiry will prove itself truly independent, and help ensure that abusers will not be able to rely on their own congregations or religious leaders to protect them - whatever their faith.\nThe Inquiry will investigate a wide range of institutions including:\nLocal authorities\nThe police\nThe Crown Prosecution Service\nThe Immigration Service\nThe BBC\nThe armed forces\nSchools\nHospitals\nChildren's homes\nChurches, mosques and other religious organisations\nCharities and voluntary organisations\nFull details of the inquiry\nCaroline Wyatt's investigation will be broadcast in Radio 4's The Report at 20:00 BST on Thursday, 23 July.\n\nSummary1:\nThe Jehovah's Witnesses' explicit policy of dealing with abuse in-house, including the requirement of two witnesses to a crime, has led to delayed justice for victims.\n\nSummary2:\nA Jehovah's Witnesses elder, Mark Sewell, was convicted of child abuse after a 20-year investigation, but the organization's in-house policy and lack of cooperation hindered justice for his victims.\n\nCan you tell me which summary you prefer?

He is getting goals, so he is leaving a footprint.\n\"Tom Cairney was the best man on the pitch at St James' Park (a 3-1 win for Fulham), but that was no surprise - he has been the best man on the pitch on many occasions - and Ryan is doing very well at Bournemouth.\n\"He is keeping out some good players, some high-value players at Bournemouth with his ability and work rate and he played very well at the weekend.\"\nRhodes had been left out of recent squads after failing to command a starting place at Middlesbrough but is now playing regularly on loan with Sheffield Wednesday.\n\"Jordan's playing and he scored a couple of goals the other week there - one was a great cross from Barry Bannan,\" said Strachan.\n\"There's an opportunity for Jordan to be in the squad because, at the moment, if you look at our strikers, there's quite a few of them not really playing regularly, but Jordan's played the last five or six games and looked comfortable in his new surroundings.\"\nGoalkeepers: Gordon (Celtic), Marshall (Hull City), McGregor (Cardiff City, on loan from Hull City)\nDefenders: Berra (Ipswich Town), Mulgrew (Blackburn Rovers), Hanley (Newcastle United), R Martin (Norwich City), Robertson (Hull City), Tierney (Celtic), Wallace (Rangers)\nMidfielders: Anya (Derby County), Bannan (Sheffield Wednesday), Brown (Celtic), Armstrong (Celtic), Burke (Leipzig), D Fletcher (West Brom), Forrest (Celtic), Cairney (Fulham), Fraser (Bournemouth), McArthur (Crystal Palace), McGinn (Hibernian), Morrison (West Brom), Phillips (West Brom), Ritchie (Newcastle United), Snodgrass (West Ham United)\nForwards: S Fletcher (Sheffield Wednesday), Griffiths (Celtic), Naismith (Norwich City), C Martin (Fulham, on loan from Derby County), Rhodes (Sheffield Wednesday, on loan from Middlesbrough)\n\nSummary1:\nScotland's national football team has announced its squad for upcoming matches, including new call-ups for Ryan Fraser and Tom Cairney, and a return for Jordan Rhodes.\n\nSummary2:\nScotland manager Gordon Strachan has named a 28-man squad for upcoming matches, including first-time call-ups for Ryan Fraser and Tom Cairney, and recalls for Allan McGregor and Jordan Rhodes.\n\nCan you tell me which summary you prefer?

I'm not sure he'll score too many goals as good as that in his career, but that's the quality Norwich City have.\n\"They've been clinical and ruthless and punished us for every mistake we've made. Having said that, it's important that in those areas where the Hoolahans and Naismiths are popping the ball off, that we get pressure on the ball and get that tackle in.\n\"With all due respect, with the first three goals and even the fourth one, we allowed them time to play and, when good players pass and move at pace, it causes anybody problems.\"\nNorwich City boss Alex Neil: \"Jacob Murphy earned his start. I played him against Hannover last week. I took him off because I had to solidify the middle of the pitch.\n\"I spoke to him throughout the week and said 'I'm not now fixing Hannover, I'm preparing to beat Blackburn.' He's responded. It's a fantastic strike.\n\"He's got the pace to terrify defenders, as he showed with his goal.

And, on 57 minutes, Naismith's left-foot shot found the bottom right corner.\nStokes' late consolation could not prevent Norwich's third win at Blackburn in 19 visits, and their second in a row, having won 2-1 on their last trip to Ewood in February 2015.\nBlackburn Rovers manager Owen Coyle: \"I don't think it's one that we wanted, envisaged or anticipated. We started the first 10 minutes very well, on the front foot, and for all intents and purposes, we looked fine.\n\"Then the lad scores a wonder goal. I'm not sure he'll score too many goals as good as that in his career, but that's the quality Norwich City have.\n\"They've been clinical and ruthless and punished us for every mistake we've made. Having said that, it's important that in those areas where the Hoolahans and Naismiths are popping the ball off, that we get pressure on the ball and get that tackle in.\n\"With all due respect, with the first three goals and even the fourth one, we allowed them time to play and, when good players pass and move at pace, it causes anybody problems.\"\nNorwich City boss Alex Neil: \"Jacob Murphy earned his start. I played him against Hannover last week. I took him off because I had to solidify the middle of the pitch.\n\"I spoke to him throughout the week and said 'I'm not now fixing Hannover, I'm preparing to beat Blackburn.' He's responded. It's a fantastic strike.\n\"He's got the pace to terrify defenders, as he showed with his goal. He's got something in his locker where he can win a game with his quality.\n\"We wanted to play in a manner which people are going to sit up and take notice of us and know that we mean business this season, and we did all that, which was really pleasing.\"\nMatch ends, Blackburn Rovers 1, Norwich City 4.\nSecond Half ends, Blackburn Rovers 1, Norwich City 4.\nAttempt missed.

He said that there was no chance of political upheaval, and pledged to press on with a package of reforms.\nThe BBC's Lina Sinjab, in Damascus, said that many had doubted that any protests would take place in Syria, but observers here believe events over the past couple of days have broken the silence that dominated the country.\n\nSummary1:\nProtesters in Syria demand release of political prisoners, including a 10-year-old boy, as President Assad's administration cracks down on dissent.\n\nSummary2:\nAbout 150 people protested near Syria's interior ministry, demanding the release of political prisoners, including a 10-year-old boy and prominent activists, amid a government crackdown on dissent.\n\nCan you tell me which summary you prefer?
