We cannot keep going with the situation that we have today.\"\nThe difficult bit is how to change the path China is on.\nOn the plus side, then, there is a growing realisation things have to change, and the media are now being allowed to debate the issue.\nChina's government seems to be in agreement. This week the cabinet approved an energy consumption \"control target\" for energy use by 2015.\nOn the minus side, that \"control target\" still means China's energy use will continue to expand, and, crucially, so will the burning of coal.\nAs Xinhua reported: \"to meet the target, average annual energy consumption growth should be controlled at around 4.3% between 2011 and 2015, lower than the 6.6-percent annual increase realized between 2006 and 2010\".\nThat means more emissions to come.\nAnd as if to prove that changing China's habits will be hard, there is another worry on the immediate horizon.\nChinese New Year is just days away. Letting off vast quantities of fireworks is part of the Spring Festival celebrations, but the fireworks produce huge amounts of pollution.\n\"Setting off fireworks contributed greatly to air pollution in Beijing for half a month after Spring Festival in 2011,\" according to Du Shaozhong, former deputy director of Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau.\nEight million people had already posted messages on China's Weibo microblogs this week debating whether the fireworks should be stopped this year.\nBut the office in charge of Beijing's firework industry has said that residents can set off fireworks during the Spring Festival holiday according to the regulations, but that the office hopes residents will refrain from doing so, the China Daily reported.\nI predict more smog.\n\nSummary1:\nBeijing is engulfed in severe smog, prompting government measures and public debate on China's environmental future and the impact of upcoming Chinese New Year celebrations.\n\nSummary2:\nBeijing's severe air pollution, caused by coal emissions and industrial gases, has worsened despite government measures, with visibility reduced to just 50m and over 100 cars involved in crashes.\n\nCan you tell me which summary you prefer?
