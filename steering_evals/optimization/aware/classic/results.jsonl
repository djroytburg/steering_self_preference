It's important for me to select the better summary for my records.\n\nArticle:\nIf confirmed, the \"exomoon\" is likely to be about the size and mass of Neptune, and circles a planet the size of Jupiter but with 10 times the mass.\nThe signal was detected by Nasa's Kepler Space Telescope; astronomers now plan to carry out follow-up observations with Hubble in October.\nA paper about the candidate moon is published on the Arxiv pre-print site.\nTo date, astronomers have discovered more than 3,000 exoplanets - worlds orbiting stars other than the Sun.\nA hunt for exomoons - objects in orbit around those distant planets - has proceeded in parallel. But so far, these extrasolar satellites have lingered at the limits of detection with current techniques.\nDr David Kipping, assistant professor of astronomy at Columbia University in New York, says he has spent \"most of his adult life\" looking for exomoons.\nFor the time being, however, he urged caution, saying: \"We would merely describe it at this point as something consistent with a moon, but, who knows, it could be something else.\"\nThe Kepler telescope hunts for planets by looking for tiny dips in the brightness of a star when a planet crosses in front - known as a transit. To search for exomoons, researchers are looking for a dimming of starlight before and after the planet causes its dip in light.\nThe promising signal was observed during three transits - fewer than the astronomers would like to have in order to confidently announce a discovery.\nThe work by Dr Kipping, his Columbia colleague Alex Teachey and citizen scientist Allan R Schmitt, assigns a confidence level of four sigma to the signal from the distant planetary system. The confidence level describes how unlikely it is that an experimental result is simply down to chance. If you express it in terms of tossing a coin, it's equivalent to tossing 15 heads in row.\nBut Dr Kipping said this is not the best way to gauge the potential detection.\nHe told BBC News: \"We're excited about it... statistically, formally, it's a very high probability. But do we really trust the statistics? That's something unquantifiable. Until we get the measurements from Hubble, it may as well be 50-50 in my mind.\"\nThe candidate moon is known as Kepler-1625b I and is observed around a star that lies some 4,000 light-years from Earth. On account of its large size, team members have dubbed it a \"Nept-moon\".\nA current theory of planetary formation suggests such an object is unlikely to have formed in place with its Jupiter-mass planet, but would instead be an object captured by the gravity of the planet later on in the evolution of this planetary system.\nThe researchers could find no predictions of a Neptune-sized moon in the literature, but Dr Kipping notes that nothing in physics prevents one.\nA handful of possible candidates have come to light in the past, but none as yet has been confirmed.\n\"I'd say it's the best [candidate] we've had,\" Dr Kipping told me.\n\"Almost every time we hit a candidate, and it passes our tests, we invent more tests until it finally dies - until it fails one of the tests... in this case we've applied everything we've ever done and it's passed all of those tests.

But they've got to improve in training and show Rob that they deserve to be first-choice players.\"\nAgainst France, Phillips believes Howley has got his selection spot on.\nHe added: \"It's a difficult one. In that international jersey should be the best because you are the best in the position.

It's important for me to select the better summary for my records.\n\nArticle:\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nKriss Akabusi, BBC Sport\n\"You are going to get the best of British competing cheek-by-jowl against the best of the rest of the world. The track and field is the centrepiece of the Olympics and is the main event. I think Team GB are set for their best Olympics ever, as not only are they wonderfully talented, but they'll be competing in front of a partisan crowd. Dai Greene and Mo Farah will be going for gold. Christine Ohuruogu is the defending 400m champion and is raring to go. After all the controversy surrounding South Africa's Caster Semenya, it is going to be great to see her put that all behind her in London. She is definitely the woman to beat in the 800m.\"\nThat athletics event remains the Games' ultimate showstopper and all eyes will be trained on Usain Bolt in the men's final on Sunday 5 August.\nBut athletics is not just about the track events; there are 47 medal events in all and just over half of these (24) are on the track. The field events, such as the triple jump and javelin, are also popular and have provided Great Britain with Olympic medals in recent years.\nFor those unable to get tickets for the Olympic Stadium, there are five road races being held on the streets of central London and finishing at the Mall. The women's marathon will see British world record holder Paula Radcliffe attempt to win gold at the third time of asking.\nThe athletics concludes with the relay races on 11 August, which should provide a fascinating finale. The men's 4x100m has been dominated by the USA but Jamaica - led by that man Bolt - broke the world record to win gold in Beijing.\nAthletics offer the widest range of choice of any Olympic sport as its various disciplines provide the opportunity to throw, run or jump.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nImmense core physical strength is required to throw a shot put that weighs 16 pounds for men and 8.8 pounds for women.\nThe test of endurance posed by the marathon sees athletes burn up to 3593 calories running a 26.2 mile course.\nFor those looking to follow in Bolt's footsteps, research has found sprinting offers a harder workout than slow and steady cardiovascular work such as long-distance running.\nIt is also an efficient way to reduce body fat and strengthen the heart muscles.\nAs training sessions are often carried out in groups, it is an excellent way to develop communication skills and learn to work effectively with other people.

This pardon puts an immediate end to her detention,\" the president tweeted.\nIn a further statement from the Elysee Palace, he said he felt her place was with her family and not in jail.\nA car carrying Ms Sauvage and her three daughters was seen leaving Reau prison soon afterwards.\nCampaigners were overjoyed by the news. But Virginie Duval, the head of the French union of magistrates, complained that the president had acted \"to please public opinion\", pointing out that the judiciary had followed the law when it rejected Ms Sauvage's appeals.\nRead more on the Sauvage case: Should presidents pardon?\nIn August, a local court rejected a plea for parole and its ruling was backed up last month by the court of appeal in Paris.\nMs Sauvage's daughters had fought for her release ever since she was jailed in 2014, insisting that she had been brutally treated throughout her marriage by her husband Norbert Marot.

It ranks behind highly unequal countries such as Colombia, Haiti and Sierra Leone.\nMonthly incomes for Hong Kong's poorest have fallen by about 8% over the past five years, while salaries for the richest have grown by about 25%, according to the newest census data.\nSze Lai Shan, a social worker with the Society for Community Organisation, said as a result of integration with the mainland, Hong Kong's economic structure had changed.\n\"The factories have moved to mainland China, and the government believes in the trickle-down theory where everyone benefits from overall economic development.

Chinese officials have promised a proper investigation, but Hong Kong people remain sceptical.\nAlthough Mr Hu's visit in 2007 coincided with pro-democracy protests, the political climate in China and Hong Kong was different at that time.\nFive years ago, China seemed relatively open to democratic reform, as it promised organisers who awarded Beijing the 2008 games.\nRestrictions were eased for foreign and Hong Kong journalists. Activists such as AIDS campaigner Hu Jia and pro-democracy campaigner Liu Xiaobo were given relative free rein to air their views.\nThe country appeared to be edging ever so slightly closer to Hong Kong's core democratic values of clean government, the rule of law and freedom of speech.\nBut this year the political atmosphere is strained as Mr Hu arrives bearing financial incentives to drum up public support.
