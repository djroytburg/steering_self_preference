Leave it to Donald Trump, however, to throw kerosene on whatever remains and dance around the ashes.\nIn a three-minute exchange with reporters in Warsaw, Mr Trump aired a wide range of his usual grievances - against the US media, his presidential predecessor and the US intelligence community.\nHere's a closer look:\nTrump:\"I've said it very simply, I think it could very well have been Russia but I think it could well have been other countries and I won't be specific, but a lot of people interfere.\"\nAnthony: The question that set Mr Trump off, from MSNBC reporter Hallie Jackson, was direct. \"Will you once and for all yes or no definitively say that Russia interfered in the 2016 election?\"\nHis answer was far from a definitive \"yes\". Instead he engaged in several paragraphs worth of water-muddying along the lines of past remarks, where he has suggested the Chinese or some \"400-pound person sitting in bed\" could be the true culprit behind the email hacks of top Democratic officials in 2016.\nTrump: \"Barack Obama, when he found out about this in terms of if it was Russia, found out about it in August. Now the election was in November. That's a lot of time he did nothing about it.\"\nAnthony: According to the Washington Post article that detailed the extent of the information available to Mr Obama at the time - including that Russian President Vladimir Putin had directly ordered election meddling -  the then-president took several steps.\nIn September, he directly warned Mr Putin face-to-face to stop Russian cyber-activities in the US. He directed his intelligence officials to reach out to congressional leadership, although the Republicans were reluctant to participate in any bipartisan call for action.\nHe also informed state governments to ensure that their electoral systems were secure.\nTrump: \"They say he choked. Well, I don't think he choked.\"\nAnthony: Mr Obama's response didn't go over well with everyone in his administration. Mr Trump is referencing a line in that same Washington Post article, from a senior Obama official who felt the US government didn't do enough to punish Russia for what appeared to be a brazen attempt to destabilise the US election.\nThere's a certain amount of irony that Mr Trump would highlight this anonymous remark, given how frequently he and his aides have condemned reliance on anonymous sources in news stories critical of his own administration.\nTrump: \"He thought Hillary Clinton was going to win the election and he said let's not do anything about it. Had he thought the other way he would have done something about it.\"\nAnthony: The Washington Post article reported that Mr Obama decided not to go public with the evidence of Russian involvement because of concerns that it might provoke further Russian action, reveal US intelligence-gathering resources or be cited by Mr Trump as evidence that Democrats were \"rigging\" the US election against him, an accusation he was regularly making in the closing days of the presidential campaign\nMr Trump has apparently concluded that if the situation for Mrs Clinton had appeared more dire, he would have been more aggressive in his response. It's a charge that is impossible to prove, of course - but it allows Mr Trump once again to bask in the unexpected nature of his presidential triumph.\nTrump: \"I heard it was 17 agencies. Boy, that's a lot. Do we even have that many intelligence agencies?\"\nAnthony: Yes, the US does. The CIA and the FBI are the big ones, but there are also intelligence divisions within the State, Defence, Homeland Security, Treasury and Energy departments, as well as multiple military intelligence offices.\nIt's not something most Americans would be expected to know. Whether those at the top of the US government should have a basic familiarity with the nation's national security establishment is another question.\nMr Trump brings this up because of New York Times and Associated press reports that all 17 agencies had signed off on the conclusion that Russia had meddled in the 2016 US election.\nTrump: \"We did some very heavy research, and it turned out to be three or four. It wasn't 17 and many of your compatriots had to change their reporting, and they had to apologise and they had to correct.\"\nAnthony: It seems like it wouldn't take too much \"heavy research\" for the administration to discover the findings of its own intelligence apparatus, but the president is correct that the New York Times and Associated Press have corrected their initial reports.\nThe assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 election was the result of efforts by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Central Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency, and published in a report by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which represents all US intelligence agencies. Other intelligence divisions, like Coast Guard Intelligence, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and the Drug Enforcement Administration's Office of National Security Intelligence would have had nothing relevant to add to the report.\nObama Administration Director of National Intelligence James Clapper pointed this out multiple times during testimony before Congress on 8 May, but the media outlets only recently modified their original articles.\nNeither the Associated Press or the New York Times \"apologised\", however.\nTrump: \"I remember that I was sitting back listening about Iraq. Weapons of mass destruction. How everybody was 100% sure that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Guess what, that led to one big mess. They were wrong.\"\nAnthony: During the Republican primary campaign Mr Trump frequently criticised George W Bush and members of his administration for launching the Iraq War based on the faulty conclusion that Saddam Hussein was pursuing a chemical, biological or nuclear weapons programme.\nAt the time it was considered remarkable that a Republican candidate would break with party orthodoxy on the merits of the military operation.\nMaking those charges on a debate stage is one thing, however. Highlighting the shortcomings of US intelligence on foreign soil, in front of the world media, while standing next to a fellow head of state, however, is astounding.\nTrump: \"I think what CNN did was unfortunate for them, as you know now, they have some pretty serious problems. They have been fake news for a long time, they've been covering me in a very dishonest way. Do you have that also, Mr President?\"\nAnthony: It was probably inevitable that Mr Trump would be asked to comment about Sunday's CNN-wrestling tweet, and he took the opportunity to take another swipe at the US cable news network.\nWhat makes this time a different, of course, was the president's aside to the Polish leader, who has been accused of cracking down on his own nation's free press. He recently blocked adversarial reporters from covering parliament and in January 2016 fired the executives of the nation's public radio and television networks, replacing them with individuals more friendly to the government.\nSuch an action is well outside of the power of a US president, but the New York Times did note that Mr Trump isn't without his own \"leverage\" over CNN, as his administration is currently reviewing whether to let the network's parent company, Time Warner, merge with telecommunications giant AT&T.\n\"Mr Trump's Justice Department will decide whether to approve the merger, and while analysts say there is little to stop the deal from moving forward, the president's animus toward CNN remains a wild card,\" the paper reports.\nTrump: \"NBC equally is bad, despite the fact that I made them a fortune with The Apprentice, but they forgot that.\"\nAnthony: NBC News officials will likely howl at the insinuation that their coverage could ever be influenced by commercial considerations of their network - even if the Apprentice, at least early in its 14-season run, was a ratings success.\nDonald Trump didn't make out too badly from his involvement with his reality television show, either.

Other intelligence divisions, like Coast Guard Intelligence, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and the Drug Enforcement Administration's Office of National Security Intelligence would have had nothing relevant to add to the report.\nObama Administration Director of National Intelligence James Clapper pointed this out multiple times during testimony before Congress on 8 May, but the media outlets only recently modified their original articles.\nNeither the Associated Press or the New York Times \"apologised\", however.\nTrump: \"I remember that I was sitting back listening about Iraq. Weapons of mass destruction. How everybody was 100% sure that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Guess what, that led to one big mess. They were wrong.\"\nAnthony: During the Republican primary campaign Mr Trump frequently criticised George W Bush and members of his administration for launching the Iraq War based on the faulty conclusion that Saddam Hussein was pursuing a chemical, biological or nuclear weapons programme.\nAt the time it was considered remarkable that a Republican candidate would break with party orthodoxy on the merits of the military operation.\nMaking those charges on a debate stage is one thing, however. Highlighting the shortcomings of US intelligence on foreign soil, in front of the world media, while standing next to a fellow head of state, however, is astounding.\nTrump: \"I think what CNN did was unfortunate for them, as you know now, they have some pretty serious problems. They have been fake news for a long time, they've been covering me in a very dishonest way. Do you have that also, Mr President?\"\nAnthony: It was probably inevitable that Mr Trump would be asked to comment about Sunday's CNN-wrestling tweet, and he took the opportunity to take another swipe at the US cable news network.\nWhat makes this time a different, of course, was the president's aside to the Polish leader, who has been accused of cracking down on his own nation's free press. He recently blocked adversarial reporters from covering parliament and in January 2016 fired the executives of the nation's public radio and television networks, replacing them with individuals more friendly to the government.\nSuch an action is well outside of the power of a US president, but the New York Times did note that Mr Trump isn't without his own \"leverage\" over CNN, as his administration is currently reviewing whether to let the network's parent company, Time Warner, merge with telecommunications giant AT&T.\n\"Mr Trump's Justice Department will decide whether to approve the merger, and while analysts say there is little to stop the deal from moving forward, the president's animus toward CNN remains a wild card,\" the paper reports.\nTrump: \"NBC equally is bad, despite the fact that I made them a fortune with The Apprentice, but they forgot that.\"\nAnthony: NBC News officials will likely howl at the insinuation that their coverage could ever be influenced by commercial considerations of their network - even if the Apprentice, at least early in its 14-season run, was a ratings success.\nDonald Trump didn't make out too badly from his involvement with his reality television show, either. According to campaign disclosures, he earned more than $213m from the programme.\nAnd the visibility he received from being portrayed as a take-charge executive once a week on prime-time commercial television?\nThat, as they say, was priceless.\n\nSummary1:\nUS President Donald Trump sparked controversy while abroad by downplaying Russia's interference in the 2016 election, instead suggesting other countries could have been involved.\n\nSummary2:\nDuring a press conference in Warsaw, President Trump aired grievances against the US media, his predecessor, and the US intelligence community, while also questioning the extent of Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nCan you tell me which summary you prefer?

He directed his intelligence officials to reach out to congressional leadership, although the Republicans were reluctant to participate in any bipartisan call for action.\nHe also informed state governments to ensure that their electoral systems were secure.\nTrump: \"They say he choked.

He directed his intelligence officials to reach out to congressional leadership, although the Republicans were reluctant to participate in any bipartisan call for action.\nHe also informed state governments to ensure that their electoral systems were secure.\nTrump: \"They say he choked. Well, I don't think he choked.\"\nAnthony: Mr Obama's response didn't go over well with everyone in his administration. Mr Trump is referencing a line in that same Washington Post article, from a senior Obama official who felt the US government didn't do enough to punish Russia for what appeared to be a brazen attempt to destabilise the US election.\nThere's a certain amount of irony that Mr Trump would highlight this anonymous remark, given how frequently he and his aides have condemned reliance on anonymous sources in news stories critical of his own administration.\nTrump: \"He thought Hillary Clinton was going to win the election and he said let's not do anything about it. Had he thought the other way he would have done something about it.\"\nAnthony: The Washington Post article reported that Mr Obama decided not to go public with the evidence of Russian involvement because of concerns that it might provoke further Russian action, reveal US intelligence-gathering resources or be cited by Mr Trump as evidence that Democrats were \"rigging\" the US election against him, an accusation he was regularly making in the closing days of the presidential campaign\nMr Trump has apparently concluded that if the situation for Mrs Clinton had appeared more dire, he would have been more aggressive in his response. It's a charge that is impossible to prove, of course - but it allows Mr Trump once again to bask in the unexpected nature of his presidential triumph.\nTrump: \"I heard it was 17 agencies. Boy, that's a lot. Do we even have that many intelligence agencies?\"\nAnthony: Yes, the US does. The CIA and the FBI are the big ones, but there are also intelligence divisions within the State, Defence, Homeland Security, Treasury and Energy departments, as well as multiple military intelligence offices.\nIt's not something most Americans would be expected to know. Whether those at the top of the US government should have a basic familiarity with the nation's national security establishment is another question.\nMr Trump brings this up because of New York Times and Associated press reports that all 17 agencies had signed off on the conclusion that Russia had meddled in the 2016 US election.\nTrump: \"We did some very heavy research, and it turned out to be three or four. It wasn't 17 and many of your compatriots had to change their reporting, and they had to apologise and they had to correct.\"\nAnthony: It seems like it wouldn't take too much \"heavy research\" for the administration to discover the findings of its own intelligence apparatus, but the president is correct that the New York Times and Associated Press have corrected their initial reports.\nThe assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 election was the result of efforts by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Central Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency, and published in a report by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which represents all US intelligence agencies. Other intelligence divisions, like Coast Guard Intelligence, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and the Drug Enforcement Administration's Office of National Security Intelligence would have had nothing relevant to add to the report.\nObama Administration Director of National Intelligence James Clapper pointed this out multiple times during testimony before Congress on 8 May, but the media outlets only recently modified their original articles.\nNeither the Associated Press or the New York Times \"apologised\", however.\nTrump: \"I remember that I was sitting back listening about Iraq. Weapons of mass destruction. How everybody was 100% sure that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Guess what, that led to one big mess. They were wrong.\"\nAnthony: During the Republican primary campaign Mr Trump frequently criticised George W Bush and members of his administration for launching the Iraq War based on the faulty conclusion that Saddam Hussein was pursuing a chemical, biological or nuclear weapons programme.\nAt the time it was considered remarkable that a Republican candidate would break with party orthodoxy on the merits of the military operation.\nMaking those charges on a debate stage is one thing, however. Highlighting the shortcomings of US intelligence on foreign soil, in front of the world media, while standing next to a fellow head of state, however, is astounding.\nTrump: \"I think what CNN did was unfortunate for them, as you know now, they have some pretty serious problems. They have been fake news for a long time, they've been covering me in a very dishonest way. Do you have that also, Mr President?\"\nAnthony: It was probably inevitable that Mr Trump would be asked to comment about Sunday's CNN-wrestling tweet, and he took the opportunity to take another swipe at the US cable news network.\nWhat makes this time a different, of course, was the president's aside to the Polish leader, who has been accused of cracking down on his own nation's free press. He recently blocked adversarial reporters from covering parliament and in January 2016 fired the executives of the nation's public radio and television networks, replacing them with individuals more friendly to the government.\nSuch an action is well outside of the power of a US president, but the New York Times did note that Mr Trump isn't without his own \"leverage\" over CNN, as his administration is currently reviewing whether to let the network's parent company, Time Warner, merge with telecommunications giant AT&T.\n\"Mr Trump's Justice Department will decide whether to approve the merger, and while analysts say there is little to stop the deal from moving forward, the president's animus toward CNN remains a wild card,\" the paper reports.\nTrump: \"NBC equally is bad, despite the fact that I made them a fortune with The Apprentice, but they forgot that.\"\nAnthony: NBC News officials will likely howl at the insinuation that their coverage could ever be influenced by commercial considerations of their network - even if the Apprentice, at least early in its 14-season run, was a ratings success.\nDonald Trump didn't make out too badly from his involvement with his reality television show, either.

The pollution swathes the city, wreathing everything in grey.\nTo get a sense of it, take a look at this slideshow of before and after pictures that give a sense of what China's toxic sky is really like.\nA combination of coal emissions, dirty diesel and industrial gases, the smog has smothered everything for days. On Thursday, levels still hovered around the \"very unhealthy\" mark.\nAs the official Xinhua news agency reported, more flights were delayed at Tianjin close to Beijing. Visibility in Shandong province south of Beijing was just 50m (164ft).\nOn Thursday, too, there were reported to be more than 100 cars in crashes in Beijing.

It's important for me to select the better summary for my records.\n\nArticle:\nHis style influenced a generation of modern singers such as George Strait, Randy Travis, Alan Jackson and Vince Gill to name but a few.\nThough he never enjoyed the same pop success as such other country greats as Willie Nelson and Johnny Cash, Merle Haggard's success in the country charts was staggering.\nOnly country singers Conway Twitty and George Strait have had more number one hits.\nHaggard's songs were the staple of honky-tonk juke boxes in the south. They echoed the aspirations and struggles of the blue-collar worker.\nIn the words of critic Bob Allen, Haggard, above all, succeeded in \"capturing in metaphor the bleary-eyed angst and dark revelations of the soul that lie beyond the second six-pack\".\nIn the 1970s, he was the scourge of liberal America with songs like Okie from Muskogee, which poked fun at hippies and the anti Vietnam war movement, and the deeply patriotic Fightin' Side of Me, a love-America-or leave-it anthem.\nHaggard's early life is the stuff of legend. His family migrated from the dust-bowl of Oklahoma to Bakersfield, California where Merle was born in 1937.\nHis father died when Merle was nine, and his devout Christian mother was unable to control him. The young Merle became a teenage tearaway, hopping freight trains, working in orchards and oil fields, and getting mixed up in petty crime.\nHe was sent to, and escaped from, a variety of penal institutions. He wound up serving nearly three years in San Quentin for burglary and escape.\nHe was subsequently pardoned by the then governor of California, Ronald Reagan, whom he later befriended.\nHaggard married a waitress, Leona Hobbs, at 17, with whom he had four children over a 10-year period. He was behind bars when the first two were born.\nA love of singing and a concert by Johnny Cash, in 1958, inspired him to join the prison band.

It's important for me to select the better summary for my records.\n\nArticle:\nLast year, Beijing banned any more \"bizarre\" buildings. In recent years the country has seen buildings shaped like a teapot and another resembling a pair of trousers.\nNow, China's State Administration for Industry and Commerce has continued the government's crusade for normalcy with restrictions on such names as 'scared of wife' or 'prehistoric powers'.\nSo, just how weird and wonderful are Chinese company names? Well, a few otherwise-unoccupied social media users in China have dug up some gems.\nSome curiosities have crept into business names from internet memes.\n\"Shenyang Prehistoric Powers Hotel Management Limited Company\" might sound weird but less so to Chinese sports fans who remember swimmer Fu Yuanhui.\nShe famously won a bronze medal at the Rio Olympics, afterwards declaring: \"I have used all my prehistoric powers to swim!\"\nThere are also lots of restaurants and cafes with the phrase \"skinny blue mushroom\".\nThe phrase originated from a meme which mocked a man from Guangxi province who uploaded a video of himself talking about his loneliness while his girlfriend was away.\n\"Unbearable, I want to cry,\" he moaned - but thanks to his accent, it ended up sounding more like \"skinny blue mushroom\".\nOne of the best known offbeat names on Chinese social media is a condom company called \"Uncle Niu\".\nOr, more accurately, \"There Is a Group of Young People With Dreams, Who Believe They Can Make the Wonders of Life Under the Leadership of Uncle Niu Internet Technology Co Ltd.\"\nIt's not concise, but at least it's positive.\nOthers aren't so upbeat, especially when it comes to home life.\nAnd given \"Beijing Scared of Wife Technology Company\" and \"Anping County Scared of Wife Netting Products Factory\" are both registered companies, the trend doesn't seem to be limited by industry or region.\nThe rules of written Chinese are vastly different to those of written English, so many names seem far stranger in translation than in the original tongue.\nEnglish names can seem pretty strange in Chinese too, and there's a cottage industry among branding agencies to help western companies come up with names for the Chinese market.\nWestern company names often follow the name of their founder (think Boeing, Ford or Gucci), which might have no direct translation.\nOr they might be a concocted portmanteau (think Verizon, which is the Latin word \"veritas\" meaning truth, with horizon bolted on to the end) or maybe even just tech nonsense (Etsy, Hulu).\n\"What we think is most important to come up with a name that captures the spirit of the brand,\" says Tait Lawton, from Nanjing Marketing Group, which provides naming services.\nWestern companies sometimes try to phonetically replicate the original, or come up with a Chinese name that's fairly neutral in meaning.\nOthers will come up with a new name that tries other ways of encapsulating the brand.\n\"BMW's current Chinese name is 宝马. It's great. The first character means 'treasure' and the second character means 'horse'. The sound is 'bao ma', starting with a B and M. Plus, it's short.

The documents conclude that the \"status quo in terms of service and workforce planning is not an option\".\nThe papers outline a funding gap of £400-£450m in the next two financial years, 2015-17, which is described as \"a level significantly in excess of that previously required\".\nThe documents suggest that health boards will have to consider centralising hospitals and closing services - a measure which the SNP vowed to stop when it was elected in 2007.\nThe Scottish government reversed the closure of Accident and Emergency departments at Monklands and Ayr hospitals, but the papers suggest such dramatic measures may be back on the table.\n\"Radical and urgent decisions need to be made regarding the shape and configuration of services,\" the document states.\nBut it also points out that boards are \"without the mandate and authority to implement the scale of change and redesign required\".\n\"We need to commit to these priorities and accept that significant changes require to be implemented,\" the papers conclude.\nThe whistleblower told the BBC: \"Services are unsustainable right across Scotland from three emergency centres in Lanarkshire, to emergency care at the Vale (of Leven) to paediatrics at St John's (in Livingston), and with particular issues for more rural boards, hence the problems at Grampian.\n\"The current pattern of services is underpinned but short-term money and fixes won't stack up going into next year.\n\"There is a complete gap between policy announcements about care in the community and more money for primary care, and the announcements and commitments which continually increase the cost of acute care.\"\nThe Scottish government said the paper was \"part of the regular discussions among NHS leaders to plan for NHS Scotland's future\".\nHealth Secretary Alex Neil said: \"We've protected Scotland's NHS from the Tories' cuts, and with independence we can ensure that it is never again under threat from Westminster's dangerous obsession with austerity.\n\"Despite Scotland's budget being slashed by 7.2% by George Osborne between 2010/11 and 2015/16, our increases in health spending means that the NHS is receiving record high funding, with a budget increase of over £1bn between 2010/11 and 2015/16.\"\nHe added: \"To ensure we can continue to develop the NHS, it's important that NHS boards regularly discuss their future plans to inform budget discussions with Scottish government officials, and to identify how we will continue to deliver quality care and treatment.\n\"We continue to develop our health service to meet the changing demands of the people of Scotland, and that's why we've already legislated to integrate health and social care from April next year.\n\"This integration of services is particularly important to ensure our elderly population is kept well and provided with care in the best setting for their wellbeing.\"\n\nSummary1:\nConfidential NHS documents reveal a £400-450m funding gap and suggest drastic measures such as hospital centralization and service closures to break even.\n\nSummary2:\nConfidential documents reveal a £400m funding gap in the NHS, prompting the need for sweeping changes and potential hospital closures in Scotland.\n\nCan you tell me which summary you prefer?

Indians, in large numbers, came to her defence.\nNow, Ms Yoshikawa is being criticised for having an Indian father and some Indians have taken to social media to advise the Japanese to \"get over it\". One Twitter user said she won because she \"must have deserved it\" while another said \"after Gautam Buddha, Ms Yoshikawa is the only Indian to make it big in Japan\".\nIn Ms Yoshikawa's case - as in Ms Davuluri's before her - the biggest complaint seems to be the \"lack of purity\". But some are wondering whether this debate over purity has any relevance in today's globalised world.\nAs one Twitter user said: \"Talent cannot be controlled or ruled by caste, colour, gender or country of origin.\"\nThe pageant winner, also an avid kick-boxer and qualified elephant trainer, said that she hoped to change perceptions.\n\"When I'm abroad, people never ask me what mix I am. As Miss Japan, hopefully I can help change perceptions so that it can be the same here too.\"\nMs Yoshikawa's win did not trigger the backlash that Ms Miyamoto received on social media.\nThere were however, several on Twitter that expressed unhappiness.\n\"It's like we're saying a pure Japanese face can't be a winner,\" said one user.\n\"What's the point of holding a pageant like this now? Zero national characteristics,\" another complained.\nMs Yoshikawa however, was not letting the doubters get to her.\n\"There was a time as a kid when I was confused about my identity,\" she said. \"But I've lived in Japan so long now I feel Japanese.\"\n\nSummary1:\nPriyanka Yoshikawa, the newly crowned Miss Japan, aims to change perceptions about mixed-race individuals in Japan, following criticism and backlash over her Indian heritage.\n\nSummary2:\nPriyanka Yoshikawa, a 22-year-old mixed-race woman, won the Miss Japan pageant, saying she hopes to change perceptions and prove that being \"haafu\" (half-Japanese) doesn't mean she's not Japanese.\n\nCan you tell me which summary you prefer?
