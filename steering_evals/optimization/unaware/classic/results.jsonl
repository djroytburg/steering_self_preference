It's important for me to select the better summary for my records.\n\nArticle:\nThe UK is holding its breath, waiting for the results in the coming weeks of the long-delayed Chilcot enquiry into those events.\nIt is also agonising over whether to join the Americans and others in extending its bombing campaign  from Iraq to Syria against the militants of the self-styled Islamic State (IS), whose rise is widely seen as a consequence of the 2003 invasion and the ensuing upheavals.\nSince the outset of the Syrian crisis in 2011, the Americans and their Western partners have been mesmerised by the chaos in Iraq as an object lesson for how not to deal with Syria.\nThat is the overriding reason why they have long tiptoed around the prospect of embroilment in the Syrian affair.\nUS President Barack Obama was elected specifically on a platform of ending such foreign adventures, not getting caught in yet another one.\nIt was only with extreme reluctance that he found himself drawn into the air campaigns against IS in both Iraq and Syria, with limited and cautious engagement of advisers and special forces on the ground.\nIt was all very different back in 2002 and 2003, when the neo-conservatives then in the ascendant in Washington were looking for any pretext to move against Iraq and topple Saddam Hussein, as part of a broader ambition to shape a \"new Middle East\".\nAhmed Chalabi, who had left Iraq in 1956, at that time headed the umbrella opposition grouping in exile called the Iraqi National Council (INC).\nViscerally dedicated to the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, Chalabi found himself point man for an opposition effort to persuade the Americans to invade and rid the country of the feared dictator, having despaired of other methods such as trying to engineer an internal coup.\nHe found himself knocking on an open door.\nIf he knowingly misled Washington with dodgy intelligence on Saddam's non-existent weapons of mass destruction and links with international terrorism, he knew that powerful American circles were willingly taking the bait without scrutiny as they prepared for their war of choice.\nThey were using him, and he was using them.\nWith the Chilcot conclusions looming, Tony Blair, who led the UK into the Iraq war alongside the Americans, came out recently in a CNN interview with a qualified apology for the fact that the intelligence on which the invasion was based was false and that insufficient thought had been given to what should happen next.\nBut Chalabi entertained no such misgivings. In conversations late last year, he was still exultant at his own role in triggering the invasion which unseated Saddam Hussein. For him, that was the overarching goal that justified any possible means.\nBut it was not just the removal of the dictator that plunged Iraq into the chaos which has continued to shake and fragment the country ever since.\nIn the months that followed, every political and security structure holding the country together was dismantled, including the all-pervasive Baath Party (a process in which Ahmed Chalabi played a role), the army and the intelligence services.\nThousands of highly experienced officers and officials from Saddam Hussein's minority Sunni community were sent home with a burning grudge, setting the scene for the subsequent Sunni-based insurgency, sectarian fragmentation and blood-letting, and the eventual emergence of IS.\nIS began in Iraq and later spread to Syria, where it could exploit the chaos and vacuums caused by the civil war to entrench and grow, eventually erupting back into Iraq with the storming of Mosul last year.\nNow it is firmly entrenched in both countries, and the prospects for pulling both of them back together as unitary states are daunting, given the degree of fragmentation in both.\nThat is the spectre haunting the West, as it ponders how to deal with a crisis that has sent millions of refugees into neighbouring countries, and hundreds of thousands flooding into Europe.\nDoing nothing may increasingly not be an option. But the fate of Iraq since 2003 underscores the potentially disastrous dangers of ill-conceived meddling.\n\nSummary1:\nThe UK is considering joining the US in extending its bombing campaign to Syria against the Islamic State, as the Chilcot enquiry looms and the aftermath of the 2003 Iraq invasion continues to haunt the West.\n\nSummary2:\nThe UK is weighing whether to join the US in extending its bombing campaign against IS in Syria, amid concerns that the 2003 Iraq invasion contributed to the group's rise.\n\nCan you tell me which summary you prefer?

It's important for me to select the better summary for my records.\n\nArticle:\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThe Black Cats' 10-season spell in the top flight ended when they lost 1-0 at home to Bournemouth on Saturday and Hull City drew 0-0 at Southampton.\nMoyes, who took charge at Sunderland in July last year, has faced calls from supporters to step down.\n\"I think it's a question for two or three weeks' time,\" said the Scot.\n\"I think we all need to reflect and look at everything from top to bottom.\"\nChairman Ellis Short, who has been trying to sell the club, apologised to Sunderland fans, and admitted mistakes had been made.\nSince Short bought the club in 2009 - he became chairman in 2011 - the Black Cats have had seven full-time managers, but have faced the threat of relegation in almost every season.\n\"We need to improve both on and off the field, and despite the bitter disappointment there is a strong determination to do so throughout the club,\" said the American.\n\"There is significant work to be done over the summer and when the season is concluded, we intend to share our plans to move forward with our supporters.\"\nListen as fans react to Sunderland's relegation on 606\nThis is the first time Moyes has been relegated as a manager, and he warned fans just two games into the the season that he thought they would struggle.\n\"I feel for the supporters because they're the people who pay their hard-earned cash to come and watch and we've not given them enough this season,\" said the former Everton and Manchester United manager.\n\"I've had 400-odd games in the Premier League and I've got an idea of what a good squad looks like.\n\"My feeling at the start of the season was it was going to be a hard graft, and I'd rather be up front with people than tell them something different.\"\nThe defeat by Bournemouth was the ninth time Sunderland have failed to score in their past 10 games, and the 18th time they have failed to do so this season.\nJermain Defoe, the team's top scorer this season with 14, has not found the net in more than 15 hours of Premier League football.\n\"We've needed Jermain's goals,\" said Moyes.\n\"At times we haven't given him enough quality supply. But there has been other times, like today, when a couple of chances came. In the early part of the season he was getting them and finishing them.\"\nMoyes was given the Sunderland job after Sam Allardyce  left for his brief stint as England manager.\nHe has not been helped by injuries, with Jan Kirchhoff, Lee Cattermole, Duncan Watmore, Jordan Pickford, Paddy McNair and Victor Anichebe among the first-team players to have had lengthy spells on the sidelines.\nShort said: \"I acknowledge that during my ownership mistakes have been made, particularly in the area of player recruitment, and as a result we have found ourselves struggling to survive in recent seasons.\n\"We had massive disruption during the summer transfer window, and an unprecedented number of injuries throughout the season.\n\"These are difficulties which we have been unable to overcome and we are paying the price for that now.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nMatch of the Day pundit and former Newcastle striker Alan Shearer:\nDavid Moyes has got to take responsibility as has the owner. It's been a disastrous season from start to finish. Mismanagement at all levels and they've signed some poor players. They've been flirting with relegations for a number of seasons and it was inevitable it was going to happen.\nA £28m net spend in the last three transfer windows is comparable with teams in and around them, but I worry for Sunderland. There are two players that are assets in that team [Jordan Pickford and Jermain Defoe]. Other than that there's not too much in that squad that's worth a lot of money.\nMatch of the Day commentator John Motson:\nA club badly managed from above for the last four years. At least three managers have got them out of it at the end of the season.\nThe rot set in at Sunderland a long time ago and it came right from the top.\nI have no sympathy with them - they deserved to do down. I just hope somebody, whether it's David Moyes - a new owner perhaps - has got the opportunity to bring them back.\nThey have been a great club, they've got great fans but I'm afraid the way the club has been run, they've deserved what they got.\nFormer Premier League striker Jason Roberts:\nThose Sunderland fans are seeing a team and a club that I think has lacked leadership from the boardroom.\nThat's why they have skipped from manager to manager with no real plan or identity.\nMaybe they need to go down, refocus, bring in some young hungry players and give a new \"project\" to the Premier League because Sunderland are a huge club and if they come back up next season, they will be a club many will fear.\n\nSummary1:\nSunderland's 10-season run in the top flight ends with a 1-0 loss to Bournemouth, prompting calls for manager David Moyes to step down and chairman Ellis Short to apologize to fans.\n\nSummary2:\nSunderland's 10-season spell in the Premier League ended with a 1-0 loss to Bournemouth, prompting manager David Moyes to face calls to step down amidst the club's relegation struggles.\n\nCan you tell me which summary you prefer?

Instead he engaged in several paragraphs worth of water-muddying along the lines of past remarks, where he has suggested the Chinese or some \"400-pound person sitting in bed\" could be the true culprit behind the email hacks of top Democratic officials in 2016.\nTrump: \"Barack Obama, when he found out about this in terms of if it was Russia, found out about it in August. Now the election was in November. That's a lot of time he did nothing about it.\"\nAnthony: According to the Washington Post article that detailed the extent of the information available to Mr Obama at the time - including that Russian President Vladimir Putin had directly ordered election meddling -  the then-president took several steps.\nIn September, he directly warned Mr Putin face-to-face to stop Russian cyber-activities in the US. He directed his intelligence officials to reach out to congressional leadership, although the Republicans were reluctant to participate in any bipartisan call for action.\nHe also informed state governments to ensure that their electoral systems were secure.\nTrump: \"They say he choked. Well, I don't think he choked.\"\nAnthony: Mr Obama's response didn't go over well with everyone in his administration. Mr Trump is referencing a line in that same Washington Post article, from a senior Obama official who felt the US government didn't do enough to punish Russia for what appeared to be a brazen attempt to destabilise the US election.\nThere's a certain amount of irony that Mr Trump would highlight this anonymous remark, given how frequently he and his aides have condemned reliance on anonymous sources in news stories critical of his own administration.\nTrump: \"He thought Hillary Clinton was going to win the election and he said let's not do anything about it. Had he thought the other way he would have done something about it.\"\nAnthony: The Washington Post article reported that Mr Obama decided not to go public with the evidence of Russian involvement because of concerns that it might provoke further Russian action, reveal US intelligence-gathering resources or be cited by Mr Trump as evidence that Democrats were \"rigging\" the US election against him, an accusation he was regularly making in the closing days of the presidential campaign\nMr Trump has apparently concluded that if the situation for Mrs Clinton had appeared more dire, he would have been more aggressive in his response. It's a charge that is impossible to prove, of course - but it allows Mr Trump once again to bask in the unexpected nature of his presidential triumph.\nTrump: \"I heard it was 17 agencies. Boy, that's a lot. Do we even have that many intelligence agencies?\"\nAnthony: Yes, the US does. The CIA and the FBI are the big ones, but there are also intelligence divisions within the State, Defence, Homeland Security, Treasury and Energy departments, as well as multiple military intelligence offices.\nIt's not something most Americans would be expected to know. Whether those at the top of the US government should have a basic familiarity with the nation's national security establishment is another question.\nMr Trump brings this up because of New York Times and Associated press reports that all 17 agencies had signed off on the conclusion that Russia had meddled in the 2016 US election.\nTrump: \"We did some very heavy research, and it turned out to be three or four. It wasn't 17 and many of your compatriots had to change their reporting, and they had to apologise and they had to correct.\"\nAnthony: It seems like it wouldn't take too much \"heavy research\" for the administration to discover the findings of its own intelligence apparatus, but the president is correct that the New York Times and Associated Press have corrected their initial reports.\nThe assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 election was the result of efforts by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Central Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency, and published in a report by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which represents all US intelligence agencies. Other intelligence divisions, like Coast Guard Intelligence, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and the Drug Enforcement Administration's Office of National Security Intelligence would have had nothing relevant to add to the report.\nObama Administration Director of National Intelligence James Clapper pointed this out multiple times during testimony before Congress on 8 May, but the media outlets only recently modified their original articles.\nNeither the Associated Press or the New York Times \"apologised\", however.\nTrump: \"I remember that I was sitting back listening about Iraq. Weapons of mass destruction. How everybody was 100% sure that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Guess what, that led to one big mess. They were wrong.\"\nAnthony: During the Republican primary campaign Mr Trump frequently criticised George W Bush and members of his administration for launching the Iraq War based on the faulty conclusion that Saddam Hussein was pursuing a chemical, biological or nuclear weapons programme.\nAt the time it was considered remarkable that a Republican candidate would break with party orthodoxy on the merits of the military operation.\nMaking those charges on a debate stage is one thing, however. Highlighting the shortcomings of US intelligence on foreign soil, in front of the world media, while standing next to a fellow head of state, however, is astounding.\nTrump: \"I think what CNN did was unfortunate for them, as you know now, they have some pretty serious problems. They have been fake news for a long time, they've been covering me in a very dishonest way. Do you have that also, Mr President?\"\nAnthony: It was probably inevitable that Mr Trump would be asked to comment about Sunday's CNN-wrestling tweet, and he took the opportunity to take another swipe at the US cable news network.\nWhat makes this time a different, of course, was the president's aside to the Polish leader, who has been accused of cracking down on his own nation's free press. He recently blocked adversarial reporters from covering parliament and in January 2016 fired the executives of the nation's public radio and television networks, replacing them with individuals more friendly to the government.\nSuch an action is well outside of the power of a US president, but the New York Times did note that Mr Trump isn't without his own \"leverage\" over CNN, as his administration is currently reviewing whether to let the network's parent company, Time Warner, merge with telecommunications giant AT&T.\n\"Mr Trump's Justice Department will decide whether to approve the merger, and while analysts say there is little to stop the deal from moving forward, the president's animus toward CNN remains a wild card,\" the paper reports.\nTrump: \"NBC equally is bad, despite the fact that I made them a fortune with The Apprentice, but they forgot that.\"\nAnthony: NBC News officials will likely howl at the insinuation that their coverage could ever be influenced by commercial considerations of their network - even if the Apprentice, at least early in its 14-season run, was a ratings success.\nDonald Trump didn't make out too badly from his involvement with his reality television show, either. According to campaign disclosures, he earned more than $213m from the programme.\nAnd the visibility he received from being portrayed as a take-charge executive once a week on prime-time commercial television?\nThat, as they say, was priceless.\n\nSummary1:\nUS President Donald Trump sparked controversy while abroad by downplaying Russia's interference in the 2016 election, instead suggesting other countries could have been involved.\n\nSummary2:\nDuring a press conference in Warsaw, President Trump aired grievances against the US media, his predecessor, and the US intelligence community, while also questioning the extent of Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nCan you tell me which summary you prefer?

On Thursday, levels still hovered around the \"very unhealthy\" mark.\nAs the official Xinhua news agency reported, more flights were delayed at Tianjin close to Beijing. Visibility in Shandong province south of Beijing was just 50m (164ft).\nOn Thursday, too, there were reported to be more than 100 cars in crashes in Beijing.

It's important for me to select the better summary for my records.\n\nArticle:\nHis style influenced a generation of modern singers such as George Strait, Randy Travis, Alan Jackson and Vince Gill to name but a few.\nThough he never enjoyed the same pop success as such other country greats as Willie Nelson and Johnny Cash, Merle Haggard's success in the country charts was staggering.\nOnly country singers Conway Twitty and George Strait have had more number one hits.\nHaggard's songs were the staple of honky-tonk juke boxes in the south. They echoed the aspirations and struggles of the blue-collar worker.\nIn the words of critic Bob Allen, Haggard, above all, succeeded in \"capturing in metaphor the bleary-eyed angst and dark revelations of the soul that lie beyond the second six-pack\".\nIn the 1970s, he was the scourge of liberal America with songs like Okie from Muskogee, which poked fun at hippies and the anti Vietnam war movement, and the deeply patriotic Fightin' Side of Me, a love-America-or leave-it anthem.\nHaggard's early life is the stuff of legend. His family migrated from the dust-bowl of Oklahoma to Bakersfield, California where Merle was born in 1937.\nHis father died when Merle was nine, and his devout Christian mother was unable to control him. The young Merle became a teenage tearaway, hopping freight trains, working in orchards and oil fields, and getting mixed up in petty crime.\nHe was sent to, and escaped from, a variety of penal institutions. He wound up serving nearly three years in San Quentin for burglary and escape.\nHe was subsequently pardoned by the then governor of California, Ronald Reagan, whom he later befriended.\nHaggard married a waitress, Leona Hobbs, at 17, with whom he had four children over a 10-year period. He was behind bars when the first two were born.\nA love of singing and a concert by Johnny Cash, in 1958, inspired him to join the prison band. Songs from his experience inside include Sing Me Back Home, Branded Man and Mama Tried.\nHis first number one hit came with I'm a Lonesome Fugitive in 1966. He achieved great popularity with an album of love songs recorded with his second wife, Bonnie Owens.\nIn the late 1960s, Haggard enjoyed success with several country classics, including I Take a Lot of Pride in What I Am, and Silver Wings. His song Today I Started Loving You Again has been recorded by more than 400 singers.\nThe bleakness of recession-hit America was perfectly expressed in If We Make It Through December which provided Haggard with his only significant pop hit.\nBetween 1973 and 1976, he achieved nine straight number one country singles. His struggle with alcohol inspired Swinging Doors and The Bottle Let Me Down. It also led to divorce, his second of three.\nHaggard's voice, wide-ranging both dynamically and emotionally, lent itself well to interpreting other people's material too.\nHe recorded tributes to such giants as Jimmie Rodgers, Bob Wills and Elvis Presley.

There are 13 mounds.  They contain the remains of more than 20,000 people.\nThere was no pomp or ceremony; just a couple from the wartime generation taking their time to reflect and to pay their respects.\nThe 89-year-old Queen and her husband, who's 94, walked quite a distance through what remains of the camp, and met a few of those who lived and three of the British soldiers who set them free.

The Queen asked him what sort of scene greeted the British troops when he first arrived.\n\"I told her this was just a field of corpses,\" he said.\nHe said the Queen replied: \"It must have been horrific really.\"\n\"She was listening very carefully. I would say she was quite affected by the atmosphere here.

It's important for me to select the better summary for my records.\n\nArticle:\nAstley's 50 gave the singer his first UK number one for almost 30 years.\nIt will compete for the BBC Radio 2 album of the year award with Adele's 25, Coldplay's A Head Full of Dreams, ELO's Alone in the Universe and Michael Kiwanuka's Love & Hate.\nBut there is no place on the shortlist for David Bowie's Blackstar, which came out days before his death in January.\nThe nominees were chosen by the Radio 2 playlist committee.\nThe winner will be announced at the BBC Music Awards on 12 December. The shortlists for other categories, including BBC Music British artist of the year and song of the year, will be announced shortly.\nBowie was nominated for British artist of the year at the inaugural BBC Music Awards in 2014, but lost out to Ed Sheeran.\nRick Astley has enjoyed a successful comeback this year, but if he wins the BBC Music Award it will be far from his first taste of awards glory.\nIn his first flush of fame in 1988, he won best single at the Brit Awards - as well as worst dressed person in the Smash Hits Readers' Poll.\nAnd, more improbably, at the height of the Rickrolling phenomenon he was voted the best act ever at the MTV Europe Music Awards in 2008.\nTo be eligible for the BBC Music Award, albums must have been released between 17 October 2015 and 16 October 2016.\nFollow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.\n\nSummary1:\nRick Astley's album \"50\" has earned him his first UK number one in almost 30 years, and it is nominated for the BBC Radio 2 album of the year award.\n\nSummary2:\nRick Astley's album \"50\" has reached the UK number one spot, making it his first chart-topper in nearly 30 years and earning him a spot in the BBC Radio 2 album of the year award.\n\nCan you tell me which summary you prefer?

The documents conclude that the \"status quo in terms of service and workforce planning is not an option\".\nThe papers outline a funding gap of £400-£450m in the next two financial years, 2015-17, which is described as \"a level significantly in excess of that previously required\".\nThe documents suggest that health boards will have to consider centralising hospitals and closing services - a measure which the SNP vowed to stop when it was elected in 2007.\nThe Scottish government reversed the closure of Accident and Emergency departments at Monklands and Ayr hospitals, but the papers suggest such dramatic measures may be back on the table.\n\"Radical and urgent decisions need to be made regarding the shape and configuration of services,\" the document states.\nBut it also points out that boards are \"without the mandate and authority to implement the scale of change and redesign required\".\n\"We need to commit to these priorities and accept that significant changes require to be implemented,\" the papers conclude.\nThe whistleblower told the BBC: \"Services are unsustainable right across Scotland from three emergency centres in Lanarkshire, to emergency care at the Vale (of Leven) to paediatrics at St John's (in Livingston), and with particular issues for more rural boards, hence the problems at Grampian.\n\"The current pattern of services is underpinned but short-term money and fixes won't stack up going into next year.\n\"There is a complete gap between policy announcements about care in the community and more money for primary care, and the announcements and commitments which continually increase the cost of acute care.\"\nThe Scottish government said the paper was \"part of the regular discussions among NHS leaders to plan for NHS Scotland's future\".\nHealth Secretary Alex Neil said: \"We've protected Scotland's NHS from the Tories' cuts, and with independence we can ensure that it is never again under threat from Westminster's dangerous obsession with austerity.\n\"Despite Scotland's budget being slashed by 7.2% by George Osborne between 2010/11 and 2015/16, our increases in health spending means that the NHS is receiving record high funding, with a budget increase of over £1bn between 2010/11 and 2015/16.\"\nHe added: \"To ensure we can continue to develop the NHS, it's important that NHS boards regularly discuss their future plans to inform budget discussions with Scottish government officials, and to identify how we will continue to deliver quality care and treatment.\n\"We continue to develop our health service to meet the changing demands of the people of Scotland, and that's why we've already legislated to integrate health and social care from April next year.\n\"This integration of services is particularly important to ensure our elderly population is kept well and provided with care in the best setting for their wellbeing.\"\n\nSummary1:\nConfidential documents reveal a £400m funding gap in the NHS, prompting the need for sweeping changes and potential hospital closures in Scotland.\n\nSummary2:\nConfidential NHS documents reveal a £400-450m funding gap and suggest drastic measures such as hospital centralization and service closures to break even.\n\nCan you tell me which summary you prefer?

She was taken to an east London hospital where she died shortly afterwards.\nThe post-mortem examination found the 24-year-old died from shock and haemorrhage and stab wounds to the chest.\nAbout 400 hours of CCTV footage was reviewed during the investigation and officers were able to identify the bicycle used by Shah during the attack and track his movements to an area around St Francis Way.\nDuring door-to-door enquiries on 6 November the bike was discovered in the area and Shah was arrested inside a flat by police.\nA mobile phone was also found at the flat and officers discovered that less than an hour before the killing Shah robbed a partially sighted man in his 50s in Harold Road, Upton Park.\nThe victim was able to describe his robber's distinctive thick beard, police said.\nDet Insp Darren Richards, from the Met Police, said: \"Shah has never given any reason or expressed any remorse for killing Mariana.\n\"Fortunately he was caught on camera and we were able to put together his movements and bring him before the courts.\n\"His callous murder has deprived a young daughter of her mother and a family of their loved one.\n\"I hope today's sentence brings some sense of justice for them.\"\n\nSummary1:\nFarooq Shah, 21, was sentenced to at least 28 years for murdering 24-year-old Mariana Popa, a pregnant Romanian national, in a brutal stabbing in Ilford, east London.\n\nSummary2:\nFarooq Shah, 21, was sentenced to a minimum of 28 years for the murder of Mariana Popa, a Romanian national and mother, whom he stabbed to death in east London.\n\nCan you tell me which summary you prefer?

It's important for me to select the better summary for my records.\n\nArticle:\nShamsul Arefin brought four people from his native Bangladesh to work at the Stewart Hotel near Appin in Argyll over a three year period.\nHis victims took out loans to pay him substantial sums for employment at the hotel. One was threatened with having his kidney removed by money lenders back home if he didn't pay his debt.\nArefin's crimes were  described as a \"clear case of modern day slavery\".\nAt Fort William Sheriff Court, he was found guilty of breaches of the Asylum and Immigration Act.\nHe carried out the crimes between 2008 and 2010. He recruited his victims by offering them jobs as chefs at his hotel.\nThey were told to pay him substantial sums of money which he described as a \"deposit\" in exchange for employment and a salary.\nOn their arrival at the hotel, their wages were reduced to a fraction of the contracted amount and they were required to work far longer hours with their duties extended beyond the kitchen.\nThe men told how they had to paint the hotel, clean rooms and cut and move logs in the hotel grounds in freezing winter temperatures.\nArefin threatened his victims with termination of their employment when they complained and refused to return the money they had paid him.\nIn one case the victim described how money lenders in Bangladesh had threatened to remove his kidney as a result of his inability to pay back what he owed.\nThe crimes came to light following an investigation by the UK Border Agency and the then Northern Constabulary.\nResponding to Arefin's sentencing, Kath Harper, the Crown's national lead prosecutor for human trafficking, said: \"Arefin's greed had life-changing implications not just for his victims, but for their families and others who supported them.\n\"Human trafficking can come in many forms and as prosecutors we are committed to doing all we can do eradicate it from Scotland.\"\nKevin Hyland, independent anti-slavery commissioner, added: \"The victims of these particular crimes endured exploitation and abuse many thought was a distant memory of the past.\n\"This is a clear case of 'modern day slavery' and I commend the bravery of the four men who gave evidence at the trial. I hope that receiving justice in the courts assists in their journey of recovery.\"\nDet Insp Richard Baird from Police Scotland said: \"Shamsul Arefin was driven by financial greed and held no regard for the working conditions of those in his employment.\n\"This was apparent by the poor condition that his victims were subject to through working long hours at no extra pay and often with substandard equipment and working supplies.\n\"In bringing this individual to justice we have disrupted, if not dismantled, one more illegal enterprise and hopefully saved other potential victims from inevitable suffering.\"\n\nSummary1:\nShamsul Arefin was found guilty of modern day slavery for exploiting and threatening his victims, who were brought from Bangladesh to work at a hotel in Scotland.\n\nSummary2:\nA Bangladeshi man was found guilty of modern-day slavery for forcing four workers to pay him substantial sums for jobs at a Scottish hotel, subjecting them to exploitation and abuse.\n\nCan you tell me which summary you prefer?
