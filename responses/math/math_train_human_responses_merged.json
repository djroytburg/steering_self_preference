Among Alice's 7 matches is a match against Bob.  Among Bob's 7 matches is a match against Alice.  When we count the total number of matches as $8 \\times 7$, the match between Alice and Bob is counted twice, once for Alice and once for Bob.\n\nTherefore, since $8 \\times 7 = 56$ counts each match twice, we must divide this total by 2 to get the total number of matches.

Checking powers of $3$, $f(9) = 13$ and $f(27)$ is beyond our boundary for $n$, so one power of $3$ works. Finally, $f(25) = 31$, which gives one more value of $n$ that works.

Note that $XY=PZ$.\n\n$Q$ is one of the desired points where the semi-circle touches the line above.  Because the diagram is symmetrical, the other point will be the mirror image of $Q$ in line $XP$.  Thus, the required distance is 2 times the length of $PQ$.\n\nNow $PQ=QZ-PZ = QZ-XY$. Since the semi-circle is tangent to the bottom line, and $YO$ is perpendicular to the bottom line and $O$ lies on a diameter, we know that $O$ is the centre of the circle. So $OY=OQ= 8$ cm, since both are radii (or since the centre always lies on a line parallel to the bottom line and a distance of the radius away).\n\nAlso, $OZ=4$ cm, since the distance between the two lines is 12 cm. By the Pythagorean Theorem (since $\\angle QZO=90^\\circ$), then \\[ QZ^2 = QO^2 - ZO^2 = 8^2 - 4^2 = 64 - 16 =48\\]so $QZ = 4\\sqrt{3}$ cm.\n\nAlso, since $QZ:ZO = \\sqrt{3}:1$, then $\\angle QOZ = 60^\\circ$.\n\nThus, the angle from $QO$ to the horizontal is $30^\\circ$, so the semi-circle has rocked through an angle of $30^\\circ$, ie. has rocked through $\\frac{1}{12}$ of a full revolution (if it was a full circle). Thus, the distance of $Y$ from $X$ is $\\frac{1}{12}$ of the circumference of what would be the full circle of radius 8, or $XY=\\frac{1}{12}(2\\pi(8))=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$ cm.

So, if we add together the $k^{th}$ terms of the expansions of $(10-2)^{25}$ and $(10+2)^{25}$, we get double the value of the $k^{th}$ term of the expansion of $(10+2)^{25}$, that is, $2 \\cdot \\binom{25}{k} \\cdot 10^{25-k} \\cdot 2^k$, if $k$ is even, and 0 if $k$ is odd.

It follows that $S + B + A$ leaves a residue of $S$ upon division by $d$. Thus, $B+A$ must be divisible by $d$. Since $B$ and $A$ cannot both be $0$, and $B+A < (d-1) + (d-1) = 2d-2$, then $B + A = d$.\n\nLooking at the $d$s digit, we must carry-over $1$ from the units digit sum, so $1 + A + B + E \\equiv S \\pmod{d}$. Since $B + A = d$, then $1 + E + d \\equiv 1+E \\equiv S \\pmod{d}$. Thus, $S = E+1$ or $E = d-1$ and $S = 0$. However, the latter is impossible since $S$ is the leftmost digit of 'SEAS' and 'SEA'. Thus, $S = E+1$, and we again carry-over $1$ to the $d^2$ digit.\n\nLooking at the $d^2$ digit, after carry-over, it follows that $1 + E + E + S \\equiv A \\pmod{d}$. Note that $1 + E + E + S < 1 + 3(d-1) = 3d - 2 < 3d$. Then, $2E + S + 1 - A$ is either equal to $0$, $d$, or $2d$. However, we can immediately discard the $0$ case: there would be no carry-over for the leftmost digit, so $S = B$ are not distinct.\n\nIn the next case, if $2E + S + 1 = A + d$, then there is a carry-over of $1$ to the last digit. It follows that $S + 1 = B$. This gives us the system of equations \\begin{align*}\nB + A &= d \\\\\nE + 1 &= S \\\\\nS + 1 &= B \\\\\n2E + S +1 - A&= d\n\\end{align*} Setting the first and fourth equations equal to each other yields that $d = B+A = 2E + S +1 - A$, and since $B = S+1 = E+2$, substituting for $B$ and $S$ yields that $2A = 3E + S + 1 - B = 2E + (E+1) + 1 - (E+2) = 2E$. This contradicts the distinct digits criterion.\n\nThus, $2E + S + 1 - A= 2d = 2(B+A)$, so $2E + S + 1 - 2B = 3A$. Also, we have that $B = S+2$, due to the carry-over in the leftmost digit. Substituting for $B$ and $S$ yields that $3A = 2E + (E+1) + 1 - 2(E + 3) = E - 4$, so $E = 3A+4$. Thus, $S = 3A+5$ and $B=3A+7$. Also, $S,E,$ and $A$ are decimal digits, so it follows that $S = 3A + 5 \\le 9 \\Longrightarrow A = 0,1$. We can discard the solution $A = 0$, as $d = B+A$ but $B < d$.

We can prime factorize $10!$ by prime factorizing each integer between 2 and 10. The exponent of 3 in the prime factorization of $10!$ is 4, since 3 and 6 each contribute one factor of 3 while 9 contributes two. Therefore, $9^2$ divides $10!$ while $9^3$ does not.

Since these two points have the same $x$-coordinate, the distance between them is the difference of their $y$-coordinates, so we have $$|(k^2+6k+5)-(mk+b)|=5.$$ Simplifying, this gives us two quadratic equations: $k^2+(6-m)k+5-b=5$ and $k^2+(6-m)k+5-b=-5$. We can express these as  \\begin{align*}\nk^2+(6-m)k-b=0&\\quad(1)\\\\\nk^2+(6-m)k+10-b=0.&\\quad(2)\n\\end{align*} We know that all solutions to both of these equations will be places where the line $y=mx+b$ is a vertical distance of $5$ from the parabola, but we know there can only be one such solution! Thus there must be exactly $1$ solution to one of the equations, and no solutions to the other equation. We find the discriminants ($b^2-4ac$) of the equations, so for equation $(1)$ the discriminant is $(6-m)^2-4(1)(-b)=(6-m)^2+4b$. For equation $(2)$ the discriminant is $(6-m)^2-4(1)(10-b)=(6-m)^2+4b-40$. One of these equations must equal zero, and one must be less than zero. Since $-40<0$, adding $(6-m)^2+4b$ to both sides doesn't change the inequality and $(6-m)^2+4b-40<(6-m)^2+4b$, so the greater value must be equal to zero so that the lesser value is always less than zero. Thus we have $(6-m)^2+4b=0$.\n\nWe are also given that the line $y=mx+b$ passes through the point $(1,6)$, so substituting $x=1$ and $y=6$ gives $6=(1)m+b$ or $m+b=6$.

Call this matrix $X_{n}$. $X_{n}$ has a first column entirely of zeros except for the first element, which is a three. A property of matrices is that the determinant can be expanded over the rows instead of the columns (still using the recursive definition as given in the problem), and the determinant found will still be the same.

Checking these digits, we find that the units digit of $b^2$ is 1 only for $b = 1$ and $b = 9$.\n\nIf $b = 1$, then $n = 10a + 1$, so \\[n^2 = 100a^2 + 20a + 1.\\] The last two digits of $100a^2$ are 00, so we want the last two digits of $20a$ to be 00.  This occurs only for the digits $a = 0$ and $a = 5$, but we reject $a = 0$ because we want a two-digit number.  This leads to the solution $n = 51$.\n\nIf $b = 9$, then $n = 10a + 9$, so \\[n^2 = 100a^2 + 180a + 81 = 100a^2 + 100a + 80a + 81.\\] The last two digits of $100a^2 + 100a$ are 00, so we want the last two digits of $80a + 81$ to be 01.  In other words, we want the last digit of $8a + 8$ to be 0.  This only occurs for the digits $a = 4$ and $a = 9$.  This leads to the solutions $n = 49$ and $n = 99$.\n\nTherefore, the sum of all two-digit positive integers whose squares end with the digits 01 is $51 + 49 + 99 = \\boxed{199}$.",

The parallelogram $AD_3BC$ has the same perimeter as the parallelogram $ABCD_2$ by symmetry, so we disregard point $D_3$.\n\nWe will find the perimeter of $ABCD_2$.

Thus, the perimeter of this parallelogram is $8+8+5+5=26$.\n\nWe will find the perimeter of $ABD_1C$. To calculate where point $D_1$ is, we note that since figure $ABC$ is symmetric about the $x$-axis, $D_1$ must lie on the $x$-axis, so its $y$ value is 0. We also know that the diagonals in a parallelogram bisect each other, so in order for diagonal $AD_1$ to bisect $BC$ (which crosses the $x$-axis at $x=2$), the $x$ value of $D_1$ must be 5. So point $D_1$ is at $(5,0)$. In finding the perimeter, we note that all the sides are equal in length. Since we already found side $AB$ to have length 5, the entire perimeter is $5\\cdot4=20$.\n\nThus, the positive difference between the greatest perimeter and the smallest is $26-20=\\boxed{6}$ units.",

The total distance that the ball falls is therefore $$\\frac{405\\left(1-\\left(\\frac23\\right)^4\\right)}{1-\\frac23} = 975.$$Now, we calculate the total distance that the ball rises. Initially, the ball rises $405(2/3)$ meters. The next time, it rises $405(2/3)(2/3)$ meters, and so on. This time, our geometric series has a first term of $405(2/3),$ common ratio $2/3,$ and three terms. Thus, the ball rises a total of $$\\frac{405\\cdot\\frac23\\left(1-\\left(\\frac23\\right)^3\\right)}{1-\\frac23} = 570.$$Adding together these two values, we find that the ball has traveled a total of $975 + 570 = \\boxed{1545}$ meters.",

We get that this fraction is equal to $\\dfrac{(2i)!}{(2i)!!^2} = \\dfrac{(2i)!}{2^{2i}(i!)^2}$.\nNow we can recognize that $\\dfrac{(2i)!}{(i!)^2}$ is simply ${2i \\choose i}$, hence this fraction is $\\dfrac{{2i\\choose i}}{2^{2i}}$, and our sum turns into $S=\\sum_{i=1}^{2009} \\dfrac{{2i\\choose i}}{2^{2i}}$.\nLet $c = \\sum_{i=1}^{2009} {2i\\choose i} \\cdot 2^{2\\cdot 2009 - 2i}$.

We do not need to calculate $8!$, only to find its last two digits. Starting with $5!$, we can work our way to $8!$, using only the last two digits of each value along the way. We know $5! = 120$, so use $20$ when finding $6!$, which will bring us to $6(20) = 120$ or $20$. Therefore, the last two digits of $7!$ are from $7(20) = 140$ or $40$. Finally $8!$ is $8(40) = 320$ or finally $20$. The last two digits of the entire series will come from $1 + 1 + 2 + 6 + 20 + 20 = 50$. Therefore, the sum of the last two digits is $5 + 0 = \\boxed{5}$.",

This means that $-a,$ $-b,$ and $-12$ cannot equal $-3,$ since when $x=-3$ in the first equation, the denominator of the fraction becomes zero.

This gives us a system of two equations:  \\begin{align*} 2l+2w& =180\n\\\\lw& =1800. \\end{align*}If we solve for $l$ in terms of $w$ using the first equation, we find that $180-2w=2l$, or $l=90-w$.

Then, drop the perpendiculars as shown.\nSince the smaller triangle is also a $6-8-10 = 3-4-5$ triangle, we can label the sides $EF,$ $CE,$ and $DF$ as $3x, 4x,$ and $5x$ respectively. Now, it is clear that $GB = DE + 1 = 4x + 1$, so $AH = AG = 8 - GB = 7 - 4x$ since $AH$ and $AG$ are both tangent to the circle P at some point. We can apply the same logic to the other side as well to get $CI = 5 - 3x$. Finally, since we have $HI = DF = 5x$, we have $AC = 10 = (7 - 4x) + (5x) + (5 - 3x) = 12 - 2x$, so $x = 1$ and $3x + 4x + 5x = \\boxed{12}$",

Now note that since $2n+1$ is odd for integral $n$, we can multiply the left integer, $100+n^2$, by a power of two without affecting the greatest common divisor. Since the $n^2$ term is quite restrictive, let's multiply by $4$ so that we can get a $(2n+1)^2$ in there.\nSo $d_n=(4n^2+400,2n+1)=((2n+1)^2-4n+399,2n+1)=(-4n+399,2n+1)$.

Notice that there are $10!$ possible pairings.\nLet a pairing be \"bad\" if it violates the stated condition. We would like a better condition to determine if a given pairing is bad.\nNote that, in order to have a bad pairing, there must exist a collection of $k<5$ pairs that includes both the left and the right shoes of $k$ adults; in other words, it is bad if it is possible to pick $k$ pairs and properly redistribute all of its shoes to exactly $k$ people.\nThus, if a left shoe is a part of a bad collection, its corresponding right shoe must also be in the bad collection (and vice versa). To search for bad collections, we can start at an arbitrary right shoe (say $R_1$), check the left shoe it is paired with (say $L_i$), and from the previous observation, we know that $R_i$ must also be in the bad collection. Then we may check the left shoe paired with $R_i$, find its counterpart, check its left pair, find its counterpart, etc. until we have found $L_1$. We can imagine each right shoe \"sending\" us to another right shoe (via its paired left shoe) until we reach the starting right shoe, at which point we know that we have found a bad collection if we have done this less than $5$ times.\nEffectively we have just traversed a cycle. (Note: This is the cycle notation of permutations.)

If $k$ is odd, then $n+1$ is even, hence $k+n-1$ is odd, and $S_n$ cannot be a perfect square. Hence $k$ must be even. In particular, as $n<1000$, we have five choices for $k$, namely $k=0,2,4,6,8$.\nIf $k=0$, then $n+1$ is odd, so $k+n-1$ is odd, hence the largest power of $2$ dividing $S_n$ has an odd exponent, so $S_n$ is not a perfect square.\nIn the other cases, note that $k+n-1$ is even, so the highest power of $2$ dividing $S_n$ will be a perfect square. In particular, $S_n$ will be a perfect square if and only if $(n+1)/2^{k}$ is an odd perfect square.\nIf $k=2$, then $n<1000$ implies that $\\frac{n+1}{4} \\le 250$, so we have $n+1 = 4, 4 \\cdot 3^2, \\ldots, 4 \\cdot 13^2, 4\\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^2$.\nIf $k=4$, then $n<1000$ implies that $\\frac{n+1}{16} \\le 62$, so $n+1 = 16, 16 \\cdot 3^2, 16 \\cdot 5^2, 16 \\cdot 7^2$.\nIf $k=6$, then $n<1000$ implies that $\\frac{n+1}{64}\\le 15$, so $n+1=64,64\\cdot 3^2$.\nIf $k=8$, then $n<1000$ implies that $\\frac{n+1}{256}\\le 3$, so $n+1=256$.\nComparing the largest term in each case, we find that the maximum possible $n$ such that $S_n$ is a perfect square is $4\\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5^2 - 1 = \\boxed{899}$.",

If we temporarily ignore the pair (3, 6), we can focus only on parity. We must arrange the six digits in such a way that no two even digits are consecutive. Using $\\color{blue}e$ to denote even and $o$ to denote odd, this gives us four different possible arrangements:\n\n\\begin{align}\n{\\color{blue}e} o {\\color{blue}e} o {\\color{blue}e} o \\\\\no {\\color{blue}e} o {\\color{blue}e} o {\\color{blue}e} \\\\\n{\\color{blue}e} o {\\color{blue}e} o o {\\color{blue}e} \\\\\n{\\color{blue}e} o o {\\color{blue}e} o {\\color{blue}e\n}\\end{align}For any of these four arrangements, there are $3!$ ways to select the three even numbers and $3!$ ways to select the three odd numbers, for a total of $3! \\cdot 3! = 36$ total arrangements. Hence, ignoring the issue of (3, 6) adjacencies, we have $36 \\cdot 4 = 144$ such numbers.\n\nNow, we must count the number of the above arrangements that include any (3, 6) adjacencies and subtract them off. Let's consider the number of (3, 6) adjacencies in arrangement $(1)$. Suppose that the first digit is 6. Then if the second digit is 3, there are $2! \\cdot 2! = 4$ arrangements of the remaining digits. So there are 4 arrangements that go 6 3 \\_ \\_ \\_ \\_. If instead the third digit is 6, then by similar reasoning, there are 4 arrangements that go \\_ 3 6 \\_ \\_ \\_, and 4 arrangements that go \\_ \\_ 6 3 \\_ \\_, for a total of 8 arrangements. By symmetry, there are also 8 arrangements that include a (3, 6) adjacency when the fifth digit is 6. So, there are a total of $4 + 8 + 8 = 20$ arrangements of $(1)$ that have 3 and 6 adjacent. By symmetry, there are also $20$ arrangements of $(2)$ that have 3 and 6 adjacent.\n\nFinally, we must count the number of arrangements of $(3)$ that have 3 and 6 adjacent. From previous reasoning, we see that if the 6 is on an endpoint, there are 4 arrangements with an adjacent 3, and if 6 is in the interior, there are 8 such arrangements. Hence, in this case, there are $4 + 8 + 4 = 16$ arrangements that have 3 and 6 adjacent. Again, by symmetry, there are also $16$ arrangements of $(4)$ with 3 and 6 adjacent.\n\nOverall, there are $20 + 20 + 16 + 16 = 72$ arrangements that have 3 and 6 adjacent.

If the product of the first $n$ rolls is $2^x 3^y$ where $x$ and $y$ are not both even, then we observe that if $x$ and $y$ are both odd, then the last roll must be 6; if only $x$ is odd, the last roll must be 2, and if only $y$ is odd, the last roll must be 3.

For each of these possibilities except $\\frac{3}{6}$ and $\\frac{6}{3}$, the fraction does not reduce, and thus the only values of $a$ and $b$ which will satisfy them are $a$ as the number in the denominator and $b$ as the number in the numerator. There is no pair of larger $(a,b)$ with the same ratio or else either $a$ or $b$ wouldn't be a single digit, and there is no pair of smaller $(a,b)$ since the fractions do not reduce. For these cases, we check to see whether $ab\\mid 10a+b$:\n\n\\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}\n$(a,b)$&$ab$&$10a+b$&Will it divide?\\\\ \\hline\n$(1,8)$&$8$&$18$&No\\\\\n$(2,7)$&$14$&$27$&No\\\\\n$(4,5)$&$20$&$45$&No\\\\\n$(5,4)$&$20$&$54$&No\\\\\n$(7,2)$&$14$&$72$&No\\\\\n$(8,1)$&$8$&$81$&No\n\\end{tabular}\n\nThe only cases which remain are those for which $\\frac{b}{a}=\\frac{6}{3}=2$, or $\\frac{b}{a}=\\frac{3}{6}=\\frac{1}{2}$. So we have $b=2a$ or $a=2b$.\n\nIf $a=2b$, we must check whether $ab\\mid 10a+b$. Substituting, we must find $b$ such that $2b^2\\mid 10(2b)+b$, or $2b^2\\mid 21b$. This means $21b=m(2b^2)$ for some integer $m$, or (since $b\\neq 0$) $21=2mb$. But the right side is even and $21$ is odd, so there are no $b$ which satisfy this and thus no numbers with $a=2b$.\n\nIf $b=2a$, again we substitute to find $2a^2\\mid 10a+2a$, or $2a^2\\mid 12a$. This means $12a=n(2a^2)$ for some integer $n$, or $6=na$, so $a$ must be a divisor of $6$. Thus $a$ can be $1,2,3$, or $6$. The corresponding values of $b$ are $2,4,6$ and $12$. But $b\\le 9$, so the pair $(6,12)$ must be thrown out and we have three possible pairs for $(a,b)$: $(1,2)$, $(2,4)$, and $(3,6)$. These correspond to the numbers $12, 24$, and $36$, and the sum is $12+24+36=\\boxed{72}$.",

Since each coin flips heads or tails with equal probability, by the principle of symmetry the probability of getting fewer heads than tails is the equal to the probability of getting fewer tails than heads. Additionally, there are only three possible outcomes: getting fewer heads than tails, getting fewer tails than heads, or getting the same number of both.
